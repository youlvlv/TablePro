# Changelog

All notable changes to TablePro will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- The table structure view has a Triggers tab for MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, SQL Server, Oracle, libSQL, and Cloudflare D1. It lists each trigger with its timing and event (plus enabled state where the engine reports it), with a filter field and sortable columns. Selecting a trigger shows its full definition in a read-only syntax-highlighted viewer. (#1695)
- Traditional Chinese (繁體中文) language in Settings > General with full UI translation
- An Add button in the table status bar inserts a new row at the end of the grid and starts editing it.

### Changed

- Selecting a Redis namespace in the sidebar key tree now filters the open database view to that prefix, with paging, instead of opening a separate tab limited to one batch of keys. (#1701)

### Fixed

- Redis entries no longer disappear after the connection sits idle. The health check was running `SELECT 1`, which on Redis switches the active database, so a later refresh scanned the wrong database. (#1701)
- Redis key browsing now lists every key in a database or namespace and pages through them correctly. It was reading only the first SCAN batch, so large keyspaces showed a partial, fixed set of keys. (#1701)
- A dropped Redis connection now reconnects on the next command and replays auth and the selected database, instead of failing until the next health check. (#1701)
- DuckDB VARIANT columns now show their value as text instead of an empty cell.
- A new database group now appears in the connection list right away instead of only after restarting the app. (#1704)
- The SQL formatter keeps nested indentation for UNION, UNION ALL, INTERSECT, and EXCEPT inside a derived table or CTE, and puts the closing parenthesis of a subquery on its own line instead of collapsing it onto the last SELECT. (#1698)
- Toolbar button tooltips now show each action's real keyboard shortcut and follow your custom bindings, instead of a fixed value. The Switch Connection tooltip showed the wrong shortcut. (#1694)

## [0.51.1] - 2026-06-16

### Added

- The tree sidebar can filter to only the databases you pick, saved per connection. (#1667)
- Closing a query tab no longer loses unsaved SQL. The next blank query tab for the same connection restores the last closed draft. (#1686)
- A checkbox in the filter panel header turns every filter row on or off at once, with a dash when only some are on.

### Changed

- The filter panel's "Unset" button is now "Clear". It keeps your filter rows and only drops the applied state. To remove the rows, use "Remove All Filters" in the filter options menu.
- A row's right-click menu now has "Apply Only This Filter". The inline per-row Apply button is gone.

### Changed

- Expanding a database in the tree sidebar loads tables first and fills in procedures and functions in the background, so the table list appears after one round-trip instead of waiting for three queries to finish in sequence.

### Fixed

- Expanding or collapsing a database or schema in the tree sidebar while its tables were still loading could crash the app. The tree now updates its rows without rebuilding the outline structure.
- MongoDB filters on `_id` and other ObjectId fields now match. A 24-character hex value is matched as an ObjectId as well as a string, so filtering by `_id` returns the row instead of nothing. (#1682)
- Shift+Arrow in the data grid now starts and extends a cell selection from the focused cell. Cmd+Shift+Arrow extends to the row or column edge.
- Delete key now removes all rows covered by a cell-range selection instead of ignoring it.
- Right-clicking inside a multi-row or cell-range selection no longer collapses the selection first.
- Oracle connections no longer crash during connect when the server sends a short or unexpected handshake packet. (#1683)
- MongoDB filters on `_id` and other ObjectId fields now match. A 24-character hex value is matched as an ObjectId as well as a string. (#1682)
- The sidebar and inspector keep their width per connection, the sidebar its collapsed state, and the inspector its selected tab, across quit and reopen.

## [0.51.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added

- BigQuery datasets can be switched, created, and dropped from the toolbar, Cmd+K switcher, and File menu. (#509)
- Quick Switcher now searches saved queries too, alongside tables, views, databases, and history.
- Quick Switcher scopes: an empty search shows recent items, and Cmd+1 to Cmd+4 browse all tables, databases, or queries.
- Quick Switcher: Option+Return opens a table in a new tab, and right-click opens its structure or copies the name or query.
- Tables already open show an Open badge in the Quick Switcher, rank higher, and Return switches to the existing tab.
- `.psql` and `.pgsql` files now open in the SQL editor like `.sql`. (#1641)
- Session restore brings back each tab's sort, page, cursor position, and column widths, plus the connection's active database and schema. Tabs autosave every 30 seconds, so a crash recovers your last session and reopens its connections. (#1673)

### Changed

- Redis connections now filter with a key-pattern search field and a key-type scope. Glob patterns like `user:*` match server-side across the whole keyspace, replacing the SQL-style filter row that only matched one batch of keys.
- Switcher, menus, and alerts now use each database's own container name: Dataset for BigQuery, Keyspace for Cassandra and ScyllaDB. (#509)
- Quick Switcher highlights matched characters, aligns camelCase and snake_case names better, and ranks items you open often and recently higher.
- Quick Switcher now opens as a Spotlight-style floating panel instead of a modal sheet, with Liquid Glass on macOS 26.
- The sidebar filter, database switcher, and connection switcher now use the same fuzzy matching as the Quick Switcher, so `upv` finds `user_profile_view`.
- Refresh (Cmd+R) now acts only on the focused window's connection instead of reloading every open connection.
- Holding Cmd+R no longer queues a backlog of refreshes; rapid presses collapse into a single reload.
- Switching PostgreSQL schemas now sets the search path to just the selected schema. Unqualified references to "public" objects, such as extension functions, need a "public." prefix while another schema is selected. (#1662)
- The inspector panel can now be resized freely by dragging its divider.
- TablePro now reopens your last session on launch by default instead of the welcome screen. Existing installs move over once; change it under Settings > General > Startup Behavior. (#1673)

### Fixed

- PostgreSQL and Redshift autocomplete now completes tables and columns from schemas other than the selected one, so `SELECT * FROM s2.orders` suggests `s2`'s columns. (#1668)
- Favorite keywords work again. Deleting a connection now also deletes its saved queries, folders, and per-table filters, the confirmation says so, and favorites orphaned by an earlier delete are cleaned up at launch.
- Keyword and SQL keyword autocomplete now work in editors without a connection, and favorites appear in the completion popup immediately.
- Typing a favorite's keyword in the Quick Switcher now finds the saved query instead of ranking it below name matches.
- PostgreSQL databases without a "public" schema now load tables from the first available schema, show the schema selector even with one schema, and count tables across every user schema. (#1662)
- Switching schemas no longer closes open tabs or discards unsaved SQL; the sidebar, schema chip, and autocomplete update to the new schema. (#1669)
- Creating a table now turns the Create Table tab into the new table's tab and shows it in the sidebar without a manual refresh. (#1664)
- Cmd+S in the Create Table tab now creates the table, matching the Save shortcut everywhere else. (#1664)
- Format Query can now be undone with Cmd+Z. (#1645)
- Format Query now formats only the selection when one is active, and the full query otherwise. (#1656)
- Foreign key jump arrows no longer disappear after sorting, filtering, or paginating, and a failed lookup is retried on the next load.
- PostgreSQL foreign keys are now read from the system catalogs, so FK jump arrows appear even when the role does not own the referenced tables.
- Sorting a query result no longer overwrites the SQL editor or an opened `.sql` file; the sort runs as a separate query. (#1645)
- iCloud Sync between the iPhone and Mac apps now uses the Production CloudKit environment, so development builds no longer sync into a separate database.
- Exports no longer fail mid-table on servers with a statement time limit; the export session disables the limit and restores it afterwards. (#1633)
- Quick Switcher no longer shows an empty table list when opened before the schema finishes loading.
- Loading a saved query or history entry from the no-tabs screen now opens it in the current window instead of a second tab.
- Opening a query from history in the Quick Switcher loads the full query instead of a 100-character preview.
- Refreshing a table now reloads its data even when the previous load is still running. (#1637)
- Cmd+R on a table now reloads its rows instead of failing with a query error.
- SQL autocomplete now suggests tables after JOIN across multi-join and multi-clause queries, with tables leading the list. (#1646)
- Large SQL scripts no longer freeze the editor or pin the CPU. Above 2 MB the editor suspends syntax highlighting and inline AI so typing and scrolling stay responsive. (#1652)

### Security

- Imported connections from a deep link or shared file can no longer carry a pre-connect script that runs a shell command on connect.
- External database links now ask for confirmation before connecting, and a password in the link is never saved to the Keychain.
- MCP tools now enforce each connection's external access level, AI policy, and token scope on every request.
- The MCP server now requires a paired token by default, even over loopback.
- An installed plugin's code signature is re-checked right before it loads, so the binary cannot be swapped after the first check.
- MongoDB filter values in the Contains, Not Contains, Starts With, Ends With, and Regex operators can no longer inject query operators.
- iOS validates TLS certificates for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Redis connections set to a verify SSL mode.
- Database values copied on iOS stay on the device and clear from the clipboard after a minute.
- The iOS home screen widget no longer stores database host and port on disk.

## [0.50.0] - 2026-06-09

### Added

- Cursor as an AI provider: use a Cursor API key or sign in with the Cursor CLI. (#1624)
- Sign in with ChatGPT to run AI chat and inline suggestions without an API key. Existing Codex CLI logins can be imported. (#1617)
- libSQL / Turso connections can open a local database file offline, transactions included. (#1607)

### Fixed

- Default row sort now applies to the first table opened after launch. (#1603)
- Cancelling a SQLite query no longer races a disconnect. (#1610)
- Typing in the query editor no longer erases characters or drops focus, most visible on macOS 15. (#1608)
- The autocomplete popup now filters in place instead of closing and reopening on each keystroke. (#1608)
- Syntax highlighting no longer disappears after formatting a query. (#1612)
- The GitHub Copilot provider no longer shows a Max output tokens field it ignores or leaves a stray model ID field behind.
- Oracle connections with native network encryption no longer crash on a server error; the real ORA error is shown and the connection keeps working. (#483)
- Clicking an already-open table switches to its tab instead of opening a duplicate. (#1613)
- MongoDB now connects over an SSH or Cloudflare tunnel instead of failing with connection refused. (#1621)
- A plugin updated in Settings stays marked Installed instead of showing the Update button again.
- DBeaver connections import from any edition, based on your DBeaver data rather than which app is installed. (#1628)

## [0.49.1] - 2026-06-06

### Fixed

- Default row sort by primary key works again for PostgreSQL and other databases, and the rows arrive already sorted on the first load instead of re-sorting after they appear. (#1603)
- Registry plugins built before 0.49.0 install and load again instead of failing with an invalid plugin bundle error.

## [0.49.0] - 2026-06-06

### Added

- Snowflake support: sign in with username & password (MFA included), key-pair, browser SSO, or an access token; browse and edit data, import CSV and JSON, edit table structure, run scripts, and switch warehouse and role from the toolbar. Snowflake CLI connections can be reused by name. (#1420)
- Import CSV and TSV files into a table: map columns to an existing table or create a new one, with delimiter, quote, encoding, header, and NULL options. (#1568)
- SQL autocomplete completes each segment of qualified names (database, schema, table), loads tables of unopened schemas on demand, resolves alias columns, and suggests the connection's dialect functions.
- Each filter row can be switched on or off and applied on its own; disabled rows stay in the panel. (#1561)
- Importing connections from other apps detects duplicates and lets you replace, add a copy, or skip each one.
- Oracle connections negotiate Native Network Encryption, so servers that require it now connect. (#483)
- Oracle connections follow listener redirects, so RAC SCAN, shared server, and load-balanced setups connect. (#483)
- AWS connections can assume an IAM role through STS, including chained source profiles, external IDs, and custom durations. (#1567)
- Redis connects to Amazon ElastiCache with IAM auth via access key, profile, or SSO. (#1567)
- AWS SSO sign-in from TablePro: an expired session prompts a browser sign-in and refreshes the token. (#1567)
- Cassandra connects to Amazon Keyspaces with AWS IAM (SigV4) auth via access keys, profile, or SSO. (#1567)
- Export and import dialogs remember the last-used format, options, and encoding; cancelling keeps your saved settings, and Reset to Defaults restores the stock options. (#1591)

### Changed

- The results status bar has a divider, balanced margins, and a spinner sized to its controls. (#1569)
- Custom keyboard shortcuts work on non-US layouts, and shifted symbols like Cmd+[ record correctly.
- The Keyboard settings list is grouped by where shortcuts act (Editor, Data Grid, Navigation, Connections), with a reset button per changed shortcut.
- Shortcut conflict detection checks live macOS system shortcuts and editor commands, and allows the same key in the editor and the data grid since focus decides which runs.
- Show Tables and Show Favorites moved to Cmd+Option+1 and Cmd+Option+2; Control+1 and Control+2 belong to macOS Spaces.
- Cmd+N opens a new connection; Manage Connections stays in the File menu.
- First Page and Last Page default to Cmd+Option+Up and Cmd+Option+Down.
- Shortcuts can use function keys (F1 through F12), with or without a modifier.
- AWS connections list the profiles from `~/.aws/config` and `~/.aws/credentials`, and still accept a typed name. (#1567)

### Fixed

- Accepting an autocomplete suggestion replaces the whole typed word; it could leave part of the word behind, turning `mess` plus Tab into `memessage`.
- MongoDB: connecting to Atlas no longer fails with TLS internal error (-9838); the plugin ships the OpenSSL TLS stack again. (#1599)
- DuckDB: the plugin runs DuckDB 1.5.2 again after a rollback to 1.5.0.
- JSON import: a failed import with "Delete existing rows before import" restores the deleted rows.
- JSON import: skip-and-continue no longer inserts duplicate rows after a mid-batch error.
- JSON import: "Stop and Commit" keeps the rows inserted before the error.
- The connection and database switcher focuses its search field even while a filter input is being edited; the filter text is kept. (#1575)
- TablePro no longer shows its icon for .sql, .sqlite, and .duckdb files when it is not their default app. (#1594)
- The JSON results view shows row data right away, follows the row selection, and shows a spinner while large results format. (#1576)
- Double-click or Enter edits a JSON cell inline and opens the hex editor on a blob cell; the chevron still opens the tree or hex editor. (#1588)
- Query results appear as soon as rows return; metadata loads in the background, removing a multi-second wait on slow remote databases. (#1574)
- MySQL and MariaDB queries are editable right away instead of waiting on a separate metadata query. (#1574)
- Status bar buttons no longer get blocked by the bottom-right window resize zone. (#1569)
- VoiceOver reads clear labels for the results status bar controls. (#1569)
- The custom rows-per-page popover points at the page-size menu. (#1569)
- DynamoDB AWS Profile auth reads `~/.aws/config` too and supports `credential_process`, so config-only, SSO, and credential-process profiles work. (#1567)
- Query result columns follow the SELECT order; new columns no longer get stuck at the end of the grid. (#1565)
- JSON file import works again. It failed to load in 0.48.0.
- SQL export quotes empty or malformed numeric values instead of producing invalid INSERT statements.
- SQL Server: logins restricted to one database, such as Azure SQL contained users, now connect; the database is sent during login.
- Custom Copy and Cut shortcuts take effect in the SQL editor.
- The Delete shortcut in the data grid follows a custom binding.
- Find Next (Cmd+G) and Find Previous (Cmd+Shift+G) work in the editor.
- Pagination buttons no longer fire their page shortcut twice.
- PostgreSQL scripts with `DO $$ ... $$` blocks or dollar-quoted bodies no longer fail with an unterminated string error. (#1559)
- AWS IAM connections no longer ask for a password; the same holds for any auth mode that replaces the password, such as a Postgres password file.
- Oracle connection failures show the listener's actual reason instead of a generic message. (#483)
- A connection password read from a command no longer fails when the command finishes quickly.
- A cancelled MCP query returns a cancelled error instead of an invalid-parameters error, and emits an initial progress notification.

## [0.48.0] - 2026-06-02

### Added

- Import a JSON file into a table: an array of objects, newline-delimited JSON, or TablePro's JSON export, mapped to a new or existing table. Pick SQL or JSON from the Import menu.
- The title bar shows the open table's name, with its database and schema below. (#1475)
- iOS: open DuckDB database files and in-memory DuckDB databases. (#1526)
- Save the current query as a favorite from the SQL editor toolbar.
- Select and copy field names and types in the row Details panel.

### Changed

- The plugin interface is now binary-stable, so app updates that add plugin capabilities no longer force installed plugins to be rebuilt.
- Connection list rows show the database name after the host, so look-alike connections are easier to tell apart. (#1535)
- Save as Favorite uses Cmd+D again. The 0.47.0 Cmd+Control+D was reserved by macOS for Look Up.
- Editor toolbar buttons show their keyboard shortcut in the tooltip, updated when you rebind it.
- Window toolbar: connection and database selectors move left as navigation items, Refresh and Save move right. Customized toolbars reset once.

### Fixed

- PostgreSQL: the selected schema stays applied after an automatic reconnect, so unqualified table names keep resolving against it. (#1540)
- Import now finds the Setapp edition of TablePlus and reads its connections. (#1528)
- Favorite keyword suggestions now appear in editor autocomplete. They were dropped before reaching the popup.
- Editor autocomplete refreshes when you switch schema, suggesting the new schema's tables and columns.
- Plugins settings: the unloaded-plugins banner now scrolls instead of pushing the plugin list off screen, shows each plugin's real icon, and only offers an Update button when a compatible build exists. Plugins waiting on a build that publishes automatically no longer show a button that fails.
- Opening a connection right after an app update no longer fails when its driver plugin needs updating. The driver updates in the background and the connection proceeds, instead of showing an error until you quit and reopen. (#1552)

## [0.47.0] - 2026-06-01

### Added

- Previous Page, Next Page, First Page, and Last Page are now in the Query menu. Previous and Next keep their Cmd+[ and Cmd+] shortcuts. (#1490)
- Keyboard control of the sidebar: focus the filter field (Cmd+Option+F) and switch between the Tables and Favorites sidebars (Ctrl+1 and Ctrl+2). Tab or Down moves from the filter field into the list. All rebindable in Settings, Keyboard. (#1490)
- Star a table in its sidebar row to favorite it. Favorites are scoped to the connection, database, and schema, pinned to the top of their section, listed in the Favorites tab, and synced through iCloud when Table Favorites is on.
- A plus button in the Tables sidebar footer creates a new table or view without right-clicking. Disabled while safe mode blocks writes.
- The sidebar can show every database on the server as an expandable tree. Switch between the flat list and the tree in the View menu (Sidebar Layout), and right-click a database or schema to set it active. Set the default for new connections in Settings, General. Applies to MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, ClickHouse, Redshift; SQLite, Redis, MongoDB, BigQuery keep their existing sidebar. (#139)
- A connection can read its password from a file, environment variable, or command at connect time instead of the Keychain, so scripts can provision it without typing the password. (#1254)
- PostgreSQL: PostGIS `geometry` and `geography` columns render as WKT with SRID instead of raw hex. (#1458)
- Import connections from Navicat: export from Navicat (File, Export Connections), then pick the file under Import from Other App. SSH tunnel and SSL settings carry over, and saved passwords are decrypted during import. (#1485)

### Changed

- Save as Favorite moved from Cmd+D to Cmd+Control+D, leaving Cmd+D free for the system "Don't Save" action. Rebindable in Settings, Keyboard. (#1490)
- The Tables sidebar footer uses native macOS styling. The schema switcher is now a borderless pull-down matching the Favorites footer, and switching schemas goes through the same path as the toolbar so filters and the active tab stay in sync.
- The Maintenance submenu in the sidebar context menu is hidden when no operations apply or the target is read-only, instead of showing an empty disabled menu.
- The window minimum width adjusts to the visible panes, so opening the inspector on a small window no longer pushes content off-screen.
- Destructive queries (DROP, TRUNCATE, DELETE without WHERE) always ask for confirmation, even with Safe Mode off. (#1481)
- Table structure changes, table creation, maintenance, column reorder, and saved data-grid edits follow the connection's Safe Mode and read-only setting. (#1481)
- AI assistant and MCP queries follow the same Safe Mode, read-only, and authentication rules as the editor. (#1481)
- iOS: sheet close, cancel, and confirm buttons use the native iOS 26 button roles, matching system apps like Mail. iOS 18 keeps titled buttons. (#1524)

### Removed

- "Create New Table…" from the sidebar right-click menu. Use the plus button in the Tables sidebar footer instead.

### Fixed

- The Details pane updates when you select a row by clicking, not only with the arrow keys. (#1496)
- Tab and Shift-Tab move focus out of the AI rules field in the connection form instead of inserting a tab. (#1490)
- The cell inspector's Set NULL, Set DEFAULT, copy, and SQL-function actions are now in a right-click menu on each field, reachable by keyboard, Full Keyboard Access, and VoiceOver, not only on hover. (#1490)
- VoiceOver: grid selection changes are announced even when VoiceOver was not already on, the drop and truncate dialog toggles describe their effect, and the favorite query editor is labeled. (#1490)
- Tab moves keyboard focus between the window panes (sidebar, results, inspector). (#1490)
- The license activation sheet focuses the key field on open, the SQL review sheet closes with Escape even while the editor has focus, and the integration token sheet focuses its Done button. (#1490)
- Copy with Headers now has a default shortcut (Cmd+Option+C) instead of appearing in the Edit menu with no key. (#1490)
- VoiceOver reads the column name and current value for each field editor in the cell inspector. (#1490)
- VoiceOver announces the active tab title when you switch between window tabs. (#1490)
- Opening a query tab no longer pulls keyboard focus from the sidebar or another control; the editor takes focus only when nothing else holds it. VoiceOver now labels the SQL editor and the Clear and Format buttons. (#1490)
- The connection form opens with the Name field focused, Return or Down in the welcome search moves to the connection list, and focus returns to the list after a sheet closes, so you can set up a connection without the mouse. (#1490)
- Escape dismisses search-based sheets and popovers (database switcher, quick switcher, column and connection pickers). The first Escape clears the search text; a second closes the sheet. (#1490)
- Running `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` in the editor opens the plan viewer instead of squashing the plan into one truncated grid cell. (#1480)
- Filtering the data grid keeps you on the keyboard: applying or clearing a filter returns focus to the grid, Return applies the filter, and Escape closes the filter panel. (#1490)
- Opening a table (Return or double-click in the sidebar) moves keyboard focus into the data grid for arrow-key navigation. Arrowing the sidebar still previews tables without taking focus. (#1490)
- Moving a connection into or out of a group syncs across devices instead of leaving it ungrouped on your other Macs.
- Opening a table on a connection with many tables no longer stalls for several seconds while autocomplete and metadata load. Schema introspection runs on separate connections instead of blocking the query that fills the grid. (#1483)
- Cassandra SSL connections with a client certificate now have a Key Passphrase field for an encrypted private key, and report "key is encrypted" or "passphrase is incorrect" instead of a generic handshake failure. The passphrase is stored in the Keychain. (#1487)

## [0.46.0] - 2026-05-28

### Added

- Rectangular cell selection in the data grid, with Shift and Cmd modifiers to extend or add cells, and Cmd+C to copy as TSV. (#1446)
- BigQuery datasets show as expandable nodes in the sidebar instead of one at a time behind a picker.
- OpenCode Zen as an AI provider, with free models when no key is set. (#1400)
- Oracle Database 11g (11.1 and 11.2) now connects. (#1425)
- Oracle connections can use a SID instead of a service name. (#1425)
- Cmd-click a foreign key arrow (or pick Open in New Tab from the right-click menu) to open the referenced table in a new tab. (#1421)
- Favorite a connection from the welcome screen; starred connections appear in a Favorites section at the top of the list. (#1302)
- Text-column cells holding JSON or PHP serialized values open in the structured viewer automatically.
- Add and remove buttons in the table structure editor (Cmd+Shift+N to add, Cmd+Delete to remove), and a labelled add button on empty Indexes or Foreign Keys tabs. (#1319)

### Changed

- The query trash button clears results too, and a Clear Results item on the right-click menu clears results alone. (#1256)
- Inserting SQL from AI Chat opens a new query tab, or fills an empty editor in place. (#1257)

### Fixed

- Safe mode level changes in the toolbar persist as the connection default across reconnects.
- Toolbar customizations persist after closing and reopening a session window. (#1455)
- Pasting rows with commas in a cell keeps each value in its own column and preserves NULL vs the literal text "NULL".
- BigQuery: switching to another table loads its data immediately instead of leaving the grid empty.
- Custom and OpenAI-compatible AI providers work when the base URL ends in `/v1`. (#1400)
- MongoDB: opening a collection no longer crashes on documents containing NaN or infinite numbers. (#1418)
- Connecting after an app update waits for in-progress plugin updates; when no compatible plugin build exists yet, the message asks you to update TablePro. (#1380)
- Failed saved connections show the Test Connection troubleshooting dialog instead of a generic alert. (#1425, #483)
- Oracle connection errors explain the cause in plain language instead of the driver's raw message. (#483)
- AWS IAM authentication with a named profile reads `~/.aws/config` and supports `credential_process`, so SSO, IAM Identity Center, and assume-role profiles work. (#1291)
- Opening a table no longer runs the initial query multiple times before data arrives.
- iOS: Safe Mode setting survives relaunch instead of reverting to Off after iCloud sync.
- iOS: large query results no longer crash the app; the editor keeps the rows it loaded and suggests adding LIMIT.
- iOS: Safe Mode "Confirm Writes" prompts before grid edits and inserts, matching the query editor.
- Redshift: schema switching, table search, and contains/starts with/ends with filters now work. (#1439)
- MCP server: turning on Require Authentication no longer hangs the first request, generates a default token if needed, and shows it once. (#1093)
- The Generate Token sheet focuses the Token Name field on first open. (#1093)
- Double-clicking a CSV or TSV file when TablePro is closed opens the file directly. (#1443)
- Opening a `.sql` file names the tab after the file instead of "SQL Query". (#1220)
- Server Dashboard shows the Slow Queries panel, with a draggable vertical split and remembered divider positions. (#1464)
- Data grid row context menus now copy the clicked or focused cell value for Copy, while Copy Rows still keeps the full-row TSV action.
- Opening a table in a new tab now restores saved hidden columns before the first load, so the initial query matches the visible column set.
- The JSON detail popover now shows long string values up to 300 characters in the tree view instead of cutting them off at 80.
- Restoring or previewing a table no longer leaves the Tables sidebar spinner stuck after the table list has already loaded.

## [0.45.0] - 2026-05-26

### Added

- Cloudflare Tunnel: connect to a database behind Cloudflare Access. TablePro starts and stops `cloudflared access tcp` per connection, the same way it manages SSH tunnels, with browser sign-in or a service token. Needs cloudflared (`brew install cloudflared`). (#1285)
- Fill Column: right-click a column header to set one value across all loaded rows. The fill is staged like a normal edit, and one undo reverts it. Not available on primary key columns. (#1304)
- AWS IAM authentication for PostgreSQL and MySQL on RDS and Aurora. Pick AWS IAM in the connection's Authentication field with an access key, named profile, or SSO. TablePro generates a fresh token on every connect and requires SSL. (#1291)
- Date picker for date, datetime, timestamp, and time cells, from the chevron button. Double-clicking still edits the cell as text, and the picker keeps the value's format, fractional seconds, and timezone offset. (#1405)
- Pagination bar for table tabs with a rows-per-page menu (5, 10, 20, 100, 500, 1,000, All rows, or custom) and First, Previous, Next, and Last buttons. (#1364)
- Click the page indicator in the pagination bar to jump to a specific page. (#1364)
- Pagination now appears for filtered tables with an unknown total row count, instead of showing only the first page. (#1364)
- First Page and Last Page keyboard actions, unbound by default and assignable in Settings > Keyboard. (#1364)
- JSON and JSONB cells display pretty-printed by default, keeping your key order and exact numbers. Viewing or reformatting no longer marks the row changed, and saving no longer reorders keys or rounds large integers.

### Fixed

- Changing the editor or data grid font size in Appearance settings now applies immediately and persists across relaunch, with no orphan custom themes left behind. (#1381)
- Installing or updating a plugin right after updating TablePro now refetches the plugin list first, so it no longer fails against a stale cached list. (#1380)
- Pressing Esc to close the Raw SQL filter suggestions, or to clear a search field, no longer also exits fullscreen. (#1403)
- Connecting an OAuth-capable MCP client like Claude Code with an invalid or expired token now shows a clear error instead of "Invalid OAuth error response". (#1409)

## [0.44.0] - 2026-05-23

### Added

- Import connections and passwords from DataGrip, including SSH tunnels and SSL settings. The source app doesn't need to be running. (#1374)

### Changed

- Active Connections is now a searchable toolbar popover instead of a modal dialog. (#1350)

### Fixed

- Connecting to a PostgreSQL-compatible engine without the pg_matviews catalog (such as db9.ai) no longer fails to load tables. (#1383)
- Filtering a table now updates the row and page counts to match the filtered result, instead of the whole-table totals.
- Reopening a table restores the filter you had applied, per connection. Removing or clearing a filter is remembered too, so an unfiltered table reopens with no filter. (#1347)
- Quick switcher panel height now fits its results instead of leaving empty space below short lists. (#1349)
- Importing connections from TablePlus brings over saved passwords again, after a recent release looked under the wrong keychain name.
- Importing an SSH connection from TablePlus no longer fills in a fake private key path when no key was selected, and skips empty TLS certificate paths.
- Importing from DBeaver no longer shows an unnecessary keychain permission warning, since DBeaver stores passwords in its own file.
- Raw SQL filter now suggests columns and keywords at every position, including after AND and OR, instead of only the first. (#1346)
- Plugins left incompatible after a TablePro update now update quietly in the background instead of showing a premature "could not be loaded" alert. You are notified only when no compatible version exists yet. (#1322)
- A plugin you download and install by hand is no longer blocked by macOS Gatekeeper once its signature is verified. (#1322)
- Clicking a table now replaces the active tab instead of opening a new one when you have multiple tabs open. A new tab still opens for unsaved edits, an applied filter, or sorting; double-click always opens a new tab. (#1348)

## [0.43.3] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- Fixed a crash when adding a row while a cell editor or value viewer was open (#1378)

## [0.43.2] - 2026-05-22

### Changed

- Hiding a column now also drops it from the query, so tables with one heavy column load faster. The primary key is always fetched so editing still works

### Removed

- Removed the embedded database CLI terminal. Use your system terminal for command-line access to your databases.

### Fixed

- Opening a connection no longer crashes when its database plugin is older than the app; outdated plugins now update automatically (#1371)
- Safe mode no longer resets when you open another table; it stays set for the connection until you change it (#1351)
- Reassigning the Execute Query, Execute All Statements, and Cancel Query shortcuts now takes effect and shows in the Query menu (#1357)
- Custom shortcuts now require a modifier key, so a plain key like Space is no longer silently ignored (#1357)
- Cancelling a pending connection no longer lets the abandoned attempt overwrite a later successful one to the same database (#1358)
- Cancelling a pending SSH connection now closes its tunnel instead of leaving the port open (#1369)
- Importing connections from DBeaver now brings over the username (#1355)
- Copying rows now includes only the visible columns, in their current order (#1354)
- The query shown in the editor when you open a table now matches the query that actually runs
- Large text columns are no longer truncated to 256 characters when browsing a table, so editing a cell can't save a shortened value

## [0.43.1] - 2026-05-20

### Added

- Right-click a column header to copy all its loaded values (#1325)
- The row "Copy as" submenu adds CSV, CSV with Headers, Markdown table, and an IN clause for `WHERE id IN (...)` lookups (#1325)
- A plugin update that arrives while a connection is open installs when you close the connection or quit, instead of being blocked
- Settings > Plugins shows a badge with the count of rejected plugins and available updates
- Connections whose driver plugin failed to load show a yellow warning triangle in the welcome list
- A rejected driver plugin shows an inline banner with an Update Plugin button in the connection form

### Changed

- A plugin that fails to load no longer interrupts launch with an alert. The app posts a notification and lists rejected plugins in Settings > Plugins with Update Now and Remove buttons (#1322)
- Rejected plugins auto-update from the registry in the background, retrying with backoff until they load (#1322)
- The app installs the plugin binary built for its own version, even when the registry holds binaries for other versions (#1322)
- Double-click or press Return on a read-only result cell to open a selectable text viewer. JSON columns open a viewer popover and BLOB columns open the hex viewer (#1336)
- `Cmd+C` copies the focused cell when one row is selected and a cell has focus; otherwise it copies the selected row(s) as TSV. `Cmd+Shift+C` always copies row(s) as TSV. "Copy with Headers" stays in the Edit and row context menus (#1332)
- `Cmd+F` toggles the filter panel on a table and opens Find in the SQL editor. The old `Cmd+Shift+F` filter shortcut is removed

### Fixed

- Fixes the recurring "Plugin was built with PluginKit version N, but version M is required" error after app updates. Rejected plugins now recover without manual steps (#1322, #1237, #923, #912, #443)
- DuckDB spatial `GEOMETRY` columns show as WKT instead of NULL (#1324)
- DuckDB `HUGEINT` and `UHUGEINT` keep full precision and no longer crash on negative values
- DuckDB streaming results respect the row cap and show `TIMESTAMPTZ`, `TIMETZ`, and `GEOMETRY` instead of NULL
- DuckDB schema reads handle apostrophes and concurrent schema switches
- DuckDB ENUMs in schemas other than `main` resolve correctly
- DuckDB `DATE` and `TIMESTAMP` BC years show a leading minus
- `.db`, `.db3`, `.s3db`, `.sl3`, and `.sqlitedb` files open from Finder (#1327)
- DynamoDB SSO connections work with `sso-session` profiles right after `aws sso login`, with no extra AWS CLI command (#1333)

## [0.43.0] - 2026-05-18

### Added

- Import connections from Beekeeper Studio, including encrypted passwords and SSH bastion hosts
- Schema picker at the bottom of the Tables sidebar to switch the active schema (#1296)
- Inline dropdown picker when editing ENUM and SET columns across MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, DuckDB, and MongoDB JSON-schema enums (#1283)
- Filter rows show an enum dropdown for `=` and `!=` operators on enum columns (#1283)
- CSV/TSV inspector: edit cells, filter, sort, add/remove/rename columns, undo/redo, auto-reload on external changes; large files stream from disk (#1259)
- iOS: SQL Server connections via FreeTDS over TDS 7.4, with schema browsing, data browser, search, filter, pagination, and explicit transactions
- iOS: Settings > Sync shows last sync time with Sync Now and Refresh from iCloud actions

### Changed

- Drivers populate allowed enum values directly in column metadata instead of parsing them downstream
- PluginKit ABI bumped to version 13; all registry plugins need to be re-tagged
- New PostgreSQL, MySQL, MariaDB, SQL Server, Redshift, and CockroachDB connections default to Preferred SSL mode, matching the native client library defaults
- MySQL and MariaDB Preferred mode now does a 2-pass connect: tries TLS first, falls back to plaintext only on SSL handshake errors (auth and network errors are not retried)
- SSL pane shows per-engine guidance and warns inline when the driver has no TLS fallback for Preferred mode
- Connection failures caused by SSL handshake errors now show a structured message naming the cause and recommending an SSL Mode to switch to, with credentials redacted from the raw driver response

### Fixed

- Import from other apps now detects TablePlus, Sequel Ace, and DBeaver via LaunchServices, so newly installed apps are picked up before they have been opened (#1305)
- ClickHouse and other HTTP-based drivers can now connect to plain-HTTP servers addressed by DNS hostname (#1316)
- Import from TablePlus now reads passwords from the keychain correctly instead of returning empty
- Port numbers no longer render with a thousand separator under locales that use a dot as a digit separator
- New query tab (Cmd+T) no longer jumps focus back to the previous table tab on SQLite and other file-based databases (#1313)
- File-based databases (SQLite, DuckDB) no longer flash the sidebar table list on window focus; external changes are picked up via the file watcher instead
- PostgreSQL connections to AWS RDS, Cloud SQL, Azure, and other hosted Postgres no longer fail with "no pg_hba.conf entry for host" (#1298)
- Oracle SSL/TCPS settings from the SSL pane are now respected; previously every Oracle connection was plain TCP
- Cassandra SSL settings from the SSL pane are now respected; previously every Cassandra connection was plain TCP
- MySQL and MariaDB Preferred mode no longer fails against Cloud SQL, Azure Database, and other hosted MySQL servers that require TLS

### Added

- CockroachDB support over the PostgreSQL wire protocol, with a Connection Options field for libpq routing (#1226)

- AI Chat: Claude extended thinking on Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, and Haiku 4.5 (#1112)
- iOS: SQL Server connections via FreeTDS over TDS 7.4, including data browser, search, filter, and pagination with SQL Server syntax
- iOS: Settings > Sync shows last sync time with Sync Now and Refresh from iCloud
- Settings > Data Grid > Default row sort opens tables sorted by primary key or first column (#1284)

### Changed

- Database switcher is now a toolbar popover with active-row checkmark, search, Refresh, and an engine-aware New Database footer (⌘N and ⌘R bound globally)
- New Database and Drop Database use native sheet and confirmation dialogs

### Security

- AI Chat: destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE, ALTER...DROP) always prompt for approval; Silent mode and Always Allow no longer bypass the check

### Fixed

- AI Chat: Gemini tool calls no longer fail with 400, `thoughtSignature` round-trips after tool runs, and DeepSeek V4 thinking is captured across turns
- AI Chat: GitHub Copilot tool registration accepts optional fields
- MySQL/MariaDB: `BIT(N)` columns display as decimal numbers instead of raw bytes (#1272)
- Structure tab: Refresh and ⌘R show external schema changes on Columns, DDL, and ClickHouse Parts (#1281)
- Query editor: Enter and ⌘+Enter work after accepting an autocomplete suggestion, and double-click no longer closes the window (#1278)
- Query editor autocomplete reflects external column renames after Refresh
- ClickHouse, BigQuery, CloudflareD1, LibSQL, Etcd, and DynamoDB: long-running queries honor Settings > Query timeout instead of failing at 30 seconds (#1267)
- MongoDB: connection form shows the Username field so auth-enabled servers stop failing with "requires authentication"
- MongoDB: deleting a host from the multi-host editor keeps the list interactive (#1293)
- SQL import: PostgreSQL dollar-quoted function bodies parse correctly, and statements are no longer dropped when the database is slower than the parser (#1264)
- SQL export: views, materialized views, and foreign tables emit the matching `DROP` (#1264)
- iOS: connections, groups, and tags survive TestFlight and App Store updates

### Removed

- Help > Report an Issue; the menu item opens GitHub Issues in a browser

## [0.41.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- File > Backup Dump… and Restore Dump… for PostgreSQL and Redshift, with live progress, cancel, and SSH tunnel reuse (#1211).

### Changed

- Plugin format updated. Older plugin builds no longer load; reinstall plugins from the registry after updating.

### Fixed

- Redis: "Required (skip verify)" SSL mode now actually skips certificate verification, so Upstash and other untrusted-CA endpoints connect (#1247).
- MSSQL: SSL mode setting now affects the connection. Previously every mode was silently ignored.
- MongoDB: "Required" and "Verify CA" SSL modes connect to self-signed and untrusted-CA servers instead of failing.
- MongoDB: connecting no longer crashes with `dispatch_sync called on queue already owned by current thread` (#1249).
- MongoDB: TLS handshake to Atlas no longer fails with `internal error (-9838)` on macOS 26.
- MongoDB: importing a connection URL with no database path now works for Atlas users restricted to one database.
- MySQL: CA certificate is no longer loaded when the SSL mode skips verification, matching PostgreSQL.

## [0.40.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- AI Chat: scrolling stays smooth on long conversations and stream completion no longer briefly hides the chat. (#1239)
- AI Chat: starting a new conversation no longer carries context from the previous one.

- MongoDB: connecting to servers older than 3.4 no longer fails on the database listing.
- ClickHouse: the index sidebar no longer fails on versions older than 19.17.

## [0.40.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Right-click Set Value on date, datetime, and timestamp cells now offers `CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME`, `NOW()`, and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, filtered by column type.
- Welcome screen left pane gains an Import from Other App button.

### Changed

- Foreign key preview popover follows the selected row as you arrow up or down.
- The connection window shows the connecting state inline with a Cancel button.

### Fixed

- Closing the connection window during a slow connect no longer leaves a stuck "Connecting…" window or a stray failure alert (#1185).
- Cmd+Z while editing a cell now undoes typing in the editor; pressing it after dismissing the editor no longer crashes.
- Cmd+Z right after Add Row no longer leaves a stranded editor floating over the removed row.
- Editing a NULL cell and dismissing without typing no longer flips the value to an empty string.
- Double-clicking another cell while editing no longer delays the new editor or drops pending changes on the previous one.
- Double-clicking an enum, set, or boolean cell now opens the inline text editor; the chevron still opens the picker popover.

- DATE columns no longer render a phantom `00:00:00` time suffix.
- Adding a new row no longer renders the row on top of the auto-opened cell editor mid-animation.

## [0.40.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Quick Switcher matches the Open Database dialog and shows a Recent section per connection.
- Connection Switcher and SQL Preview open as sheets so they work from the toolbar, overflow menu, and keyboard shortcuts.
- Filters button moved out of the toolbar; the bottom-bar Filters control remains.
- Welcome screen drops the Import Connections button; both import flows remain in the + menu.

### Fixed

- Toolbar overflow menu entries now fire their action when the window is narrowed.
- SQL Preview no longer freezes when previewing a very large batch.
- Quick Switcher crash on macOS 26.
- Registry updates for bundled drivers (ClickHouse, Redis) now persist after restart.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Welcome window: "Check for Updates" link next to the version number
- Window menu: dedicated Integrations Activity window for the MCP activity log and connected clients. Sidebar, native search, filter, refresh, export. Position remembered across launches
- Sample database (Chinook) bundled. Open from welcome screen with one click; reset via File menu
- Connection string detection: paste a `postgres://`, `mysql://`, `redis://`, or `mongodb://` URL to auto-fill the form
- MCP: protocol versions `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25` (in addition to `2025-03-26`). Includes structured tool output (`structuredContent`), tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, etc.), `completions` capability, and streaming progress notifications via `notifications/progress`
- MCP: pairing redirect carries `error=denied` when the user clicks Deny
- MCP: re-pairing the same client name revokes the previous token
- Oracle 10G password verifier auth, matching DBeaver/JDBC/sqlplus (#483)
- Oracle Test Connection: diagnostic sheet on auth failure with copy-able info, suggested actions, and an issue link
- Oracle connection negotiation matches python-oracledb 23ai (TTC4 boundary, TTC5 token/pipelining/sessionless, OCI3 sync, dequeue selectors, sparse vectors)
- SSH tunnel resolves `~/.ssh/config` host aliases at connection time, with full `ssh_config(5)` semantics: glob `Host` patterns, all `Match` types, `ProxyJump`, hostname canonicalization, `Include`. Live (no app restart). Applies to primary host and jump hosts (#977)

### Changed

- Welcome window aligned to macOS HIG: subtle drop shadow on the app icon (no accent glow), dynamic text styles, "Sponsor" button removed, "Create connection" uses the bordered style, toolbar `+` / new-group buttons gain a hover background, native window vibrancy via `NSVisualEffectView`
- Settings > Integrations is a flat preferences pane per macOS HIG. Activity log and connected-clients moved to the new Integrations Activity window; setup snippets to a "Connect a Client…" sheet
- MCP: idle session timeout 5 → 15 minutes
- MCP: server, stdio bridge, and protocol dispatcher rewritten for spec compliance. Public API of `MCPServerManager` and the on-disk handshake format unchanged; clients do not need to re-pair
- Security: non-syncing keychain items use `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`. Keeps local-only secrets out of unencrypted device backups. Existing items keep their accessibility class until you re-save
- Settings > Sync > Passwords: caption clarifies the toggle only affects new saves

### Removed

- SSH `useSSHConfig` per-connection toggle. `~/.ssh/config` is always consulted now; explicit form values still take precedence
- Legacy-keychain migration and password-sync-state migration. Both violated Apple's Data Protection keychain contract on sandboxed macOS and corrupted credentials. Stale items in the legacy keychain can be cleaned via Keychain Access

### Fixed

- Welcome / connection form / feedback panel now remember position and size across launches (frame autosave was missing on the underlying `NSWindow`/`NSPanel`)
- Saved connection passwords no longer disappear after relaunch. The legacy-keychain migration was deleting the only copy on sandboxed macOS; removed entirely
- Cmd+Z after editing a cell now clears the yellow "modified" highlight (the coordinator's `dataTabDelegate` was being nilled too eagerly)
- Tab switching: rapid Cmd+Number no longer leaves a tail of tab transitions after key release. AppKit switches now apply synchronously via `NSAnimationContext` with `duration = 0`
- Oracle: TIMESTAMP variants, INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND, INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH, DATE, RAW, and BLOB render through typed decoders. INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH and BFILE no longer crash on row fetch. Unknown types show `<unsupported: type>` instead of crashing (#965)
- Oracle: 23ai cloud and container handshakes no longer fail with `uncleanShutdown`. OOB urgent-byte send now requires `TNS_ACCEPT_FLAG_CHECK_OOB` advertisement (#483)
- Plugin install prompt reopens when connecting to a downloadable database type whose plugin is disabled or uninstalled (#975)
- Redshift: schema switcher no longer empty for non-admin users. Reads from `pg_namespace` filtered by `has_schema_privilege` instead of `information_schema.schemata` (#971)
- MCP: GET `/mcp` opens a real SSE notification stream
- MCP: concurrent tool calls no longer serialize at the dispatcher loop
- MCP: server validates `protocolVersion` and `MCP-Protocol-Version`; rejects unknown versions with `-32600 invalid_request`
- MCP: 429 responses include a real `Retry-After` header from the rate-limiter lockout
- MCP: token revocation cancels in-flight requests and terminates sessions
- MCP: CORS reflects the request `Origin` against an allowlist (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `claude.ai`, `app.cursor.com`)
- MCP: stale `Mcp-Session-Id` after idle timeout returns JSON-RPC `-32001 "Session not found"` with HTTP 404, letting clients re-initialize cleanly instead of hanging until a 4-minute client timeout
- MCP: stdio bridge uses `FileHandle.bytes` AsyncBytes (no more silent exit on briefly empty stdin)
- MCP: SSE responses stream incrementally instead of buffering
- MCP: rate limiter keys on `(client_address, principal_fingerprint)` to close localhost auth-DoS
- MCP: in-app setup snippets use the stdio command form for `tablepro-mcp` (Claude Desktop rejected the URL form)
- MCP: duplicate `initialize` returns `invalid_request` instead of overwriting `clientInfo`
- MCP: `xcodebuild test` no longer leaves an orphan `TablePro.app` running
- MCP: server start cleans stale handshake file from a crashed previous PID
- MCP: activity log auto-refreshes when new audit entries are written

## [0.37.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- External API for Raycast, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients. New Integrations panel with token-based pairing (PKCE), per-connection access control, and a 90-day activity log
- New MCP tools: `list_recent_tabs`, `search_query_history`, `open_connection_window`, `open_table_tab`, `focus_query_tab`
- Per-connection External Access setting (`blocked` / `readOnly` / `readWrite`); effective scope is the minimum of token scope and connection level
- PostgreSQL ICU collation provider in Create Database (PG 15+)
- Connection URL parsing supports SSH `user:password@host`, multi-host, MongoDB auth params, and Redis database index
- SSH Private Key auth auto-resolves keys from `~/.ssh/config` and default locations (`id_ed25519`, `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`)
- Single-click cell editing in the data grid (no more double-click)
- Multi-cell paste from TSV clipboard data, grouped as one undo
- Shift+Tab navigates to the previous cell
- Copy rows in TSV, HTML table, and plain text for richer paste in spreadsheet apps
- AI provider settings allow manually entering a model name when the provider does not return one
- VoiceOver: column headers announce sort direction and priority; cells expose row and column index ranges

### Changed

- Result safety cap is enforced after the query runs, not by rewriting your SQL. When a result is capped, the status bar shows "Showing N rows (truncated)" with a Fetch All button. Load More on user-query tabs is removed; table-tab pagination is unchanged
- MCP server lazy-starts on first external request; manual enable is gone
- Settings tab renamed from "MCP" to "Integrations" with sections for connected clients, activity log, and pairing
- Activity log gained an Export button that writes the current filtered list to CSV
- Connection Advanced settings: AI Policy and External Clients share a single External Access section with a segmented control
- Create Database is driver-driven; engines without creation support hide the Create button instead of failing on click
- Data grid: persistent column reuse pool, SF Symbol sort indicators that respect light and dark mode, header divider taps trigger resize instead of sort, focus ring follows system accent
- Data grid undo/redo uses the window's UndoManager, unifying Cmd+Z across editor and grid
- Right-click during cell editing shows the native text context menu instead of the row menu
- OpenSSL shared as dylib across app and plugins, reducing bundle size by ~15MB

### Removed (BREAKING)

- Old name-based deep links (`tablepro://connect/{name}/...`) are gone. Use UUID-keyed paths from "Copy Connection Deep Link" in the sidebar context menu; saved bookmarks must be regenerated
- MCP server data directory moved from `~/Library/Application Support/com.TablePro/` to `~/Library/Application Support/TablePro/`. Re-pair external clients after upgrading. Delete the old directory with `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.TablePro`
- Separately distributed plugins (Oracle, DuckDB, MSSQL, MongoDB, BigQuery, LibSQL, Cassandra, Etcd, Cloudflare D1, DynamoDB) require update before use. PluginKit ABI bumped to 9
- Settings renamed: `enforceQueryResultLimit` is now `truncateQueryResults`, `queryResultLimit` is now `queryResultRowCap`. Custom values revert to defaults on first launch

### Fixed

- SELECT queries with a user-written LIMIT now return the requested row count. The query engine no longer strips your LIMIT and substitutes its own cap, so `LIMIT 10` returns 10 rows. Affected SQLite, DuckDB, LibSQL, ClickHouse, Redshift, Cloudflare D1, and the MCP query path. MSSQL and Oracle no longer silently inject `ORDER BY 1` either (#956)
- Crash on macOS 26 when opening SQL Preview
- File associations for `.sql`, `.sqlite`, `.duckdb` now appear in Finder's Open With menu
- New tab from the empty state replaces the placeholder instead of opening a side-by-side tab
- PostgreSQL Create Database collation errors on glibc-initialized servers (#927)
- Redshift Create Database emits valid `COLLATE { CASE_SENSITIVE | CASE_INSENSITIVE }` instead of PostgreSQL `LC_COLLATE` syntax
- SSH agent and `IdentityAgent` socket paths now expand `~` so 1Password and similar agents work
- Connection form `usePrivateKey=true` from URL no longer disables Test and Create buttons
- Transient connections from URL clean up keychain entries on connection failure
- Native Search Field focus regression when clearing text
- Group and connection deletions persist before firing the sync notification, fixing a race that could re-upload deleted records to iCloud
- MCP `execute_query`: trailing semicolons no longer break appended LIMIT/OFFSET
- Pairing approval: 5-minute countdown timer, searchable connection list, can no longer grant via Return key, requires explicit Approve click
- Token deletion and client disconnect now require confirmation
- Activity log: searchable across action, token, connection, and details; connection name shown instead of UUID prefix; single scroll owner
- Token, audit, and pairing sheets respect Dynamic Type and dark mode; warning banner stays visible in dark mode
- Token list switched to a native list with keyboard navigation, multi-select, and a context menu (Revoke, Copy ID, Delete)
- "Last used" timestamps use RelativeDateTimeFormatter for correct localization
- Refuse to generate SQL when the database dialect cannot be resolved, instead of silently emitting unquoted identifiers

- Import database connections from SSH tunnel URLs (e.g., `mysql+ssh://`, `postgresql+ssh://`)
- Connection groups for organizing database connections into folders with colored headers

### Fixed

- Toolbar briefly showing "MySQL" and missing version (e.g., "MongoDB" instead of "MongoDB 8.2.5") when opening a new tab
- Keyboard shortcuts not working (beep sound) after connecting from welcome screen until a second tab is opened
- Toolbar overflow menu showing only one item and missing all other buttons when window is narrow

- Consolidate ExportService @Published properties into single state struct — reduces objectWillChange events from 7 per batch to 1
- Consolidate ImportService @Published properties into single state struct — reduces objectWillChange events during SQL import
- Replace DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter chains in AppDelegate startup with structured Task-based retry loops
- Merge 3 identical Combine notification subscriptions in SidebarViewModel into Publishers.Merge3
- Make AIChatStorage encoder/decoder static — shared across all instances instead of duplicated

### Fixed

- Cell edit showing modified background but displaying original value until save (reloadData during active editing ignored by NSTableView, updateNSView blocked by editedRow guard)
- Undo on inserted row cell edit not syncing insertedRowData (stale values after undo)
- Vim Escape key not exiting Insert/Visual mode when autocomplete popup is visible (popup's event monitor consumed the key)
- Copy (Cmd+C) and Cut (Cmd+X) not working in SQL editor — clipboard retained old value due to CodeEditTextView's copy: silently failing
- Vim yank/delete operations not syncing to system clipboard (register only stored text internally)
- Vim word motions (`w`, `b`, `e`) using two-class word boundary detection instead of correct three-class (word chars, punctuation, whitespace)
- Vim visual mode selection now correctly includes cursor character (inclusive selection matching real Vim behavior)
- Arrow keys now work in Vim visual/normal mode (mapped to h/j/k/l instead of bypassing the Vim engine)
- Vim block cursor now follows the moving end of the selection in visual mode instead of staying at the anchor
- Vim visual mode selection highlight now renders visibly (trigger needsDisplay after programmatic selection)
- Fix event monitor leaks in SQL editor — `deinit` now cleans up NSEvent monitors, notification observers, and work items that leaked when CodeEditSourceEditor never called `destroy()`
- Fix unbounded memory growth from NativeTabRegistry holding full QueryTab objects (including RowBuffer references) — registry now stores lightweight TabSnapshot structs
- Fix SortedRowsCache storing full row copies — now stores index permutations only, halving sorted-tab memory
- Fix schema provider memory leak — shared providers are now reference-counted with 5s grace period removal when all windows for a connection close
- Fix duplicate schema fetches in InlineSuggestionManager — now shares the coordinator's SQLSchemaProvider instead of maintaining a separate cache
- Fix background tabs retaining full result data indefinitely — RowBuffer eviction frees memory for inactive tabs (re-fetched on switch back)
- Fix InMemoryRowProvider bulk cache eviction — now uses proximity-based eviction keeping entries near current scroll position
- Fix stale tabRowProviders entries when tab IDs change without count changing
- Fix crash on macOS 14.x caused by `_strchrnul` symbol not found in libpq.5.dylib — switch libpq and OpenSSL from dynamic Homebrew linking to vendored static libraries built with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0
- Fix duplicate tabs and lag when inserting SQL from AI Chat or History panel with multiple window-tabs open — notification handlers now only fire in the key window
- Fix "Run in New Tab" race condition in History panel — replaced fragile two-notification + 100ms delay pattern with a single atomic notification
- Fix MainContentCoordinator deinit Task that may never execute — added explicit teardown() method with didTeardown guard and orphaned schema provider purge
- Fix SQLEditorCoordinator deinit deferring InlineSuggestionManager cleanup to Task — added explicit destroy() lifecycle and didDestroy guard with warning log
- Fix ExportService while-true batch loops not checking Task.isCancelled — cancelled exports now stop promptly instead of running all remaining batches
- Fix DataGridView full column reconfiguration on every resultVersion bump — narrowed rebuild condition to only trigger when transitioning from empty state
- Fix ConnectionHealthMonitor fixed 30s interval that delays failure detection — added checkNow() with wakeUpContinuation for immediate health checks and exponential backoff
- Fix HistoryPanelView and TableStructureView asyncAfter copy-reset timers not cancellable — replaced with cancellable Task pattern
- Fix MainContentView redundant onChange handler causing cascading re-renders on tab/table changes
- Fix DatabaseManager notification observer creating unnecessary Tasks when self is already deallocated — added guard let self before Task creation

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Refactored sidebar table list to MVVM architecture with testable SidebarViewModel
- Extracted TableRow and context menu into separate files (TableRowView.swift, SidebarContextMenu.swift)
- Migrated to native macOS window tabs (`NSWindow` tabbing) — tab bar is now rendered by macOS itself, identical to Finder/Safari/Xcode tabs with automatic dark/light mode support, drag-to-reorder, and "Merge All Windows" for free
- Each tab is a full independent window with its own sidebar, editor, and state — no more shared tab manager or ZStack keep-alive pattern
- New Tab (Cmd+T) creates a native macOS window tab; Close Tab (Cmd+W) closes the native tab
- Tab switching (Cmd+Shift+[/], Cmd+1-9) now uses native macOS tab navigation
- Sidebar table selection is per-window-tab (independent of other tabs)
- Tab persistence now saves/restores combined state from all native window tabs via NativeTabRegistry; restored tabs reopen as individual native window tabs
- Sidebar table click navigates in-place when no unsaved changes; opens new native tab when dirty
- FK navigation follows the same in-place/new-tab behavior based on unsaved changes
- "Show All Tables" now opens metadata query in a new native tab instead of appending to the current window
- Create Table success closes the create-table window and opens the new table in a fresh native tab
- Window title updates dynamically after navigate-in-place (sidebar click, FK navigation)

### Fixed

- Sidebar loses keyboard focus (arrow key navigation) after opening a second table tab
- Sidebar active state flash and loss when clicking a table that opens in a new native window tab — removed the async revert; each window now re-syncs its sidebar via `NSWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification`, and programmatic syncs skip navigation via an early-return guard
- Sidebar loses active state when opening a second table in a new native window tab — `handleTabSelectionChange` now calls `syncSidebarToCurrentTab()` so the new window's empty `localSelectedTables` is seeded from the restored tab
- Sidebar now refreshes immediately after switching databases via Cmd+K — clears `session.tables` during the switch so `SidebarView.onChange` triggers `loadTables()` against the new database without requiring a manual refresh
- Cmd+W in empty state (after all tabs are cleared) now closes the connection window and disconnects, instead of doing nothing
- Fix Cmd+K database switch flooding all windows with error alerts — `.refreshAll` broadcast caused every window to re-execute its table query against the wrong database; now only the current tab re-executes, and only if its table exists in the new database
- Fix clicking a table in the sidebar replacing the current tab instead of opening a new native tab
- Fix clicking a table from a query tab overwriting the SQL editor instead of opening a separate table tab
- Tab persistence no longer overwrites combined state from all windows when a single window saves — uses NativeTabRegistry for combined state
- Query text editing in one window no longer corrupts other windows' persisted tab state
- Fix Cmd+W on any tab disconnecting the session and showing welcome screen — now only disconnects when the last main window is closed
- Fix Cmd+T from empty state creating two native tabs instead of one — now adds a query tab to the current window
- Fix clicking a table in the sidebar from empty state not opening the table — now creates a table tab in the current window
- Fix native tab title showing "SQL Query" instead of the table name when opening a table from empty state
- Fix Cmd+W on the last tab disconnecting the session instead of returning to empty state

### Removed

- Removed broken SidebarFocusRestorer (non-functional NSViewRepresentable focus hack)
- Removed dead code: unused onTablePro callback, single-table toggle methods
- Custom AppKit tab bar (NativeTabBarView) — replaced by native macOS window tab bar
- Removed vestigial multi-tab code: `performDirectTabSwitch`, `skipNextTabChangeOnChange`, `tabPendingChanges`, `tabSelectionCache`, `lastFlushTime`, `filterStateSavedExternally`, `flushSelectionCache`, `duplicateTab`, `togglePin`, `selectTab`, `switchToDatabase` (legacy)

### Performance

- Cache SQLSchemaProvider per connection so new native tabs reuse the already-loaded schema instead of re-fetching tables and columns from the database (saves 500ms-2s per tab)
- Schema loading now runs in background, no longer blocks the data query from starting — table data appears immediately while autocomplete schema loads concurrently
- Remove unconditional 100ms sleep in `waitForConnectionAndExecute` when connection is already established
- Defer `loadTableMetadataIfNeeded` until after the tab's first query completes, avoiding a redundant DB round-trip during tab initialization
- Replace `@ObservedObject dbManager` in ContentView with targeted `@State` + `onReceive` — eliminates O(N) view cascade where every window re-rendered on any DatabaseManager state change
- Remove `@StateObject dbManager` from TableProApp — prevents app-level body re-evaluation on every DatabaseManager publish
- Batch `connectToSession` session mutations into a single `activeSessions` write — reduces 5 separate `objectWillChange` publishes to 1
- Remove redundant `DatabaseManager.updateSession` calls in tab change handlers — NativeTabRegistry already handles persistence, eliminating unnecessary `@Published` cascades
- Add initialization guard to `initializeAndRestoreTabs` preventing duplicate query execution from racing `.task` and `onChange(of: selectedTabId)` paths
- Replace `onChange(of: DatabaseManager.shared.currentSession?.*)` with per-window `onReceive` filtered by connection ID — stops SwiftUI from tracking the global DatabaseManager singleton as a dependency
- Guard health monitor status writes to skip no-op `.connected` → `.connected` transitions — eliminates idle 30-second cascade on all windows
- Extract all menu commands into `AppMenuCommands` struct — `AppState` changes now only re-evaluate menu items, not the Scene body / all WindowGroups
- Add `isContentViewEquivalent(to:)` comparison on `ConnectionSession` — skips `@State` writes when only `tabs`, `selectedTabId`, or `lastActiveAt` changed, preventing O(N) MainContentView.init cascade across windows

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Quick search and filter rows can now be combined — when both are active, their WHERE conditions are joined with AND
- Foreign key columns now show a navigation arrow icon in each cell — click to open the referenced table filtered by the FK value

### Changed

- Metadata queries (columns, FKs, row count) now run on a dedicated parallel connection, eliminating 200-300ms delay for FK arrows and pagination count on initial table load
- Approximate row count from database metadata displays instantly with data; exact count refines silently in the background
- Show warning indicator on filter presets referencing columns not in current table
- Increase filter row height estimate for better accessibility support
- FK navigation now uses dedicated FilterStateManager.setFKFilter API instead of direct property manipulation
- Add syntax highlighting to Import SQL file preview
- XLSX export now enforces the Excel row limit (1,048,576) per sheet and uses autoreleasepool per row to reduce peak memory during large exports
- Multiline cell values now use a scrollable overlay editor instead of the constrained field editor, enabling proper vertical scrolling and line navigation during inline editing
- AnyChangeManager now uses a reference-type box for lazy initialization, avoiding Combine pipeline creation during SwiftUI body evaluation
- DataGridView identity check moved before AppSettingsManager read to skip settings access when nothing has changed
- DataGridView async column width write-back now uses an isWritingColumnLayout guard to prevent two-frame bounce
- Tab switch flushPendingSave debounced to skip redundant saves within 100ms of rapid tab switching
- SQL editor frame-change notification throttled to 50ms to avoid redundant syntax highlight viewport recalculation on every keystroke
- SQL editor text binding sync now uses O(1) NSString length pre-check before O(n) full string equality comparison
- Toolbar executing state now fires a single objectWillChange instead of double-publishing isExecuting and connectionState
- Row provider onChange handlers coalesced into a single trigger to avoid redundant InMemoryRowProvider rebuilds
- SQL import now uses file-size estimation instead of a separate counting pass, eliminating the double-parse overhead for large files
- History cleanup COUNT + DELETE now wrapped in a single transaction to reduce journal flushes
- SQLite `fetchTableMetadata` now caps row count scan at 100k rows to avoid full table scans on large tables
- SQLite `fetchIndexes` uses table-valued pragma functions in a single query instead of N+1 separate PRAGMA calls
- MySQL empty-result DESCRIBE fallback now only triggers for SELECT queries, avoiding redundant round-trips for non-SELECT statements
- Remove redundant `String(query)` copy in MariaDB query execution
- MySQL result fetching now uses `mysql_use_result` (streaming) instead of `mysql_store_result` (full buffering), so only the capped row count is held in memory instead of the entire server result set
- Instant pagination via approximate row count — MySQL/PostgreSQL tables now show "~N rows" immediately with data, then refine to exact count in background
- QueryTab uses value-based equality for SwiftUI diffing, eliminating unnecessary ForEach re-renders on tab array writes
- Cached static regex for `extractTableName`, `SQLiteDriver.stripLimitOffset`, and SQL function expressions to avoid per-call compilation
- Static NumberFormatter in status bar to avoid per-render locale resolution
- Batch `TableProTabSmart` field writes into single array store to avoid 14 CoW copies per query execution
- Tab persistence writes moved off main thread via `Task.detached`
- Single history entry per SQL import instead of per-statement recording
- WAL mode enabled for query history SQLite database
- Merged `fetchDatabaseMetadata` into single query for MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Health ping now uses dedicated metadata driver to avoid blocking user queries
- SSH tunnel setup extracted into shared helper to eliminate code duplication
- PostgreSQL DDL queries restructured with `async let` for cleaner dispatch (sequential on serial connection queue)
- Cancel query connection now uses 5-second connect timeout
- PostgreSQL connection parameters properly escaped for special characters
- SQLite `fetchAllColumns` overridden with single `sqlite_master` + `pragma_table_info` query
- Eliminated intermediate `[UInt8]` buffer in MySQL and PostgreSQL field extraction
- Column layout sync gated behind user-resize flag to skip O(n) loop on cursor moves
- Column width calculation uses monospace character arithmetic instead of per-row CoreText calls
- DataChangeManager maintains change index incrementally instead of full O(n) rebuild
- JSON export buffers writes per row instead of per field
- `SQLFormatterService` uses NSMutableString for keyword uppercasing and integer counter for placeholders
- SQLContextAnalyzer uses single alternation regex and single-pass state machine for string/comment detection
- `escapeJSONString` iterates UTF-8 bytes instead of grapheme clusters
- `AppSettingsStorage` caches JSONDecoder/JSONEncoder as stored properties
- `AppSettingsManager` stores validated settings in memory after didSet
- `FilterSettingsStorage` uses tracked key set instead of loading full plist
- Keychain saves use `SecItemAdd` + `SecItemUpdate` upsert pattern instead of delete + add
- Autocomplete `detectFunctionContext` uses index tracking instead of character-by-character string building

### Fixed

- Fix AND/OR filter logic mode ignored in query execution — preview showed correct OR logic but actual query always used AND
- Fix filter panel state (filters, visibility, quick search, logic mode) not preserved when switching between tabs
- Fix foreign key navigation filter being wiped when switching to a new tab (tab switch restore overwrote FK filter state)
- Fix pagination count appearing 200-300ms after data loads — approximate row count from database metadata now displays instantly with data, exact count refines silently in the background
- Fix foreign key navigation arrows and pagination count appearing with visible delay on initial table load — metadata now fetches on a dedicated parallel connection concurrent with the main query
- Fix LibPQ parameterized query using Swift `deallocate()` for `strdup`-allocated memory instead of `free()`
- FTS5 search input now sanitized to prevent parse errors from special characters like \*, OR, AND
- Fix SQL export corrupting newline/tab/backslash characters for PostgreSQL and SQLite (MySQL-style backslash escaping was incorrectly applied to all database types)
- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export failing to import when types/sequences already exist (`DROP IF EXISTS` now always emitted for dependent types and sequences)
- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export missing `CREATE TYPE` definitions for enum columns, causing import errors
- Fix PostgreSQL DDL tab not showing enum type definitions used by table columns
- Fix compilation error for PostgreSQL dependent sequences export (`fetchDependentSequences` missing from `DatabaseDriver` protocol)
- Fix PostgreSQL LIKE/NOT LIKE expressions missing `ESCAPE '\'` clause, causing wildcard escaping (`\%`, `\_`) to be treated as literal characters
- Fix SQLite regex filter silently degrading to LIKE substring match instead of being excluded from the WHERE clause

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export failing to fetch DDL for tables (passed quoted identifier instead of raw table name to catalog queries)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Extract shared `performDirectTabSwitch` into `MainContentCoordinator` to eliminate duplicate tab-switch logic
- Welcome window now uses native macOS frosted glass translucency (NSVisualEffectView with behind-window blending)

### Fixed

- Auto-detect MySQL vs MariaDB server type from version string to use correct timeout variable (`max_execution_time` for MySQL, `max_statement_time` for MariaDB)
- Improved tab switching performance by caching row providers and change managers across SwiftUI render cycles
- Eliminated selection sync feedback loop causing redundant DataGridView updates during tab switch
- Enabled NSTableView row view recycling to reduce heap allocations during scrolling
- Reduced SwiftUI re-render cascades by batching @Published mutations during tab switch
- Improved DataGrid scrolling performance:
    - Row views now recycled via NSTableView's reuse pool instead of allocating new objects per scroll
    - Replaced O(n) String.count with O(1) NSString.length for large cell value truncation
    - Replaced expensive NSFontDescriptor.symbolicTraits checks with O(1) pointer equality on cached fonts
    - Added layerContentsRedrawPolicy and canDrawSubviewsIntoLayer to reduce compositing overhead
    - Cached NULL display string locally instead of per-cell singleton access
    - Cached AnyChangeManager to avoid per-render allocation with Combine subscriptions
    - Deferred accessibility label generation to when VoiceOver is active
    - Removed unnecessary async dispatch in focusedColumn, collapsed two reloadData calls into one

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Replace hardcoded opacity on semantic colors with `quaternaryLabelColor`/`tertiaryLabelColor`
- Use `shadowColor` instead of `Color.black` for shadows
- Replace iOS-style Capsule badges with RoundedRectangle

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

    - **I/O:** Throttled history cleanup (IO-1), async history storage migration (IO-2), consolidated onChange handlers (IO-3)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Inline AI suggestions (ghost text) in the SQL editor — auto-triggers on typing pause, Tab to accept, Escape to dismiss
- Schema-aware inline suggestions — AI now uses actual table/column names from the connected database (cached with 30s TTL, respects `includeSchema` and `maxSchemaTables` settings)
- AI feature highlight row on onboarding features page
- Added VoiceOver accessibility labels to custom controls: data grid (table view, column headers, cells), filter panel (logic toggle, presets, action buttons, filter row controls), toolbar buttons (connection switcher, database switcher, refresh, export, import, filter toggle, history toggle, inspector toggle), editor tab bar (tab items, close buttons, add tab button), and sidebar (table/view rows, search clear button)

### Changed

- Migrated notification observers in `MainContentCommandActions` from Combine publishers (`.publisher(for:).sink`) to async sequences (`for await` over `NotificationCenter.default.notifications(named:)`) — removes `AnyCancellable` storage in favor of `Task` handles with proper cancellation on deinit
- Migrated tab state persistence from UserDefaults to file-based storage in Application Support — prevents large JSON payloads from bloating the plist loaded at app launch, with automatic one-time migration of existing data
- Refactored menu and toolbar commands from NotificationCenter to `@FocusedObject` pattern — menu commands and toolbar buttons now call `MainContentCommandActions` methods directly instead of posting global notifications, with context-aware routing for structure view operations
- Redesigned connection form with tab-based layout (General / SSH Tunnel / SSL/TLS / Advanced), replacing the single-scroll layout
- Revamped connection form UI to use native macOS grouped form style (`Form`/`.formStyle(.grouped)`) with `LabeledContent` for automatic label-value alignment and `Section` headers — replacing the previous hand-rolled `VStack` layout with custom `FormField` component
- Removed unused `FormField` component and helper methods (`iconForType`, `colorForType`)
- SQLite connections now only show General and Advanced tabs (SSH/SSL hidden)
- Added async/await wrapper methods to `QueryHistoryStorage` — existing completion-handler API preserved for compatibility, new `async` overloads use `withCheckedContinuation` for modern Swift concurrency callers

### Fixed

- Fixed TOCTOU race condition in `SQLiteDriver` — replaced `nonisolated(unsafe)` + DispatchQueue pattern with a dedicated actor (`SQLiteConnectionActor`) that serializes all sqlite3 handle access, preventing concurrent task races on the connection state
- Consolidated multiple `.sheet(isPresented:)` modifiers in `MainContentView` into a single `.sheet(item:)` with an `ActiveSheet` enum — fixes SwiftUI anti-pattern where only the last `.sheet` modifier reliably activates
- Replaced blocking `Process.waitUntilExit()` calls in `SSHTunnelManager` with async `withCheckedContinuation`-based waiting, and replaced the fixed 1.5s sleep with active port probing — SSH tunnel setup no longer blocks the actor thread, keeping the UI responsive during connection
- Eliminated potential deadlocks in `MariaDBConnection` and `LibPQConnection` — replaced all `queue.sync` calls (in `disconnect`, `deinit`, `isConnected`, `serverVersion`) with lock-protected cached state and `queue.async` cleanup, preventing deadlocks when callbacks re-enter the connection queue
- SQL editor now respects the macOS accessibility text size preference (System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Text Size) — the user's chosen font size is scaled by the system's preferred text size factor, with live updates when the setting changes
- Fixed retain cycle in `UpdaterBridge` — `.assign(to:on:self)` retains self strongly; replaced with `.sink` using `[weak self]`
- Fixed leaked NotificationCenter observer in `SQLEditorCoordinator` — observer token is now stored and removed in `destroy()`
- Eliminated tab switching delay — replaced view teardown/recreation with `ZStack`+`ForEach` to keep NSViews alive, moved tab persistence I/O to background threads, skipped unnecessary change-tracking deep copies, and coalesced redundant inspector/sidebar updates during tab switch
- Reduced tab-switch CPU spikes from 40-60% to ~10-20% by eliminating redundant `reloadData()` calls: `configureForTable` no longer triggers a reload during tab switch (single controlled bump instead of 2-3), `onChange(of: resultColumns)` is suppressed while the switch is in progress, and `DataGridView.updateNSView` skips all heavy work when the data identity hasn't changed
- Table open now shows data instantly — split `executeQueryInternal` into two phases: rows display immediately after SELECT completes, metadata (columns, FKs, enums, row count) loads in the background without blocking the grid
- Eliminated 20-80ms overhead when clicking an already-open table in the sidebar — `openTableTab` short-circuits immediately, and `TableProTabSmart` no longer fires `@Published` when the selected tab hasn't changed
- Keychain `SecItemAdd` return values are now checked and logged — previously, failed writes (e.g. `errSecDuplicateItem`, `errSecInteractionNotAllowed`) were silently discarded, risking password loss
- Added `kSecAttrService` to all Keychain queries across `ConnectionStorage`, `LicenseStorage`, and `AIKeyStorage` — items now have a proper service identifier, preventing potential collisions with other apps
- Ensured proper cleanup for `@State` reference type tokens — tracked untracked `Task` instances in `ImportDialog` (file selection), `AIProviderEditorSheet` (model fetching, connection test), and added `onDisappear` cancellation to prevent leaked work after view dismissal
- Replaced `.onAppear` with `.task` for I/O operations in `ConnectionTagEditor` — uses SwiftUI-idiomatic lifecycle-tied loading instead of `onAppear` which can re-fire on navigation

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- AI chat panel — native macOS inspector styling: removed iOS-style chat bubbles, flattened message layout with role headers and compact spacing, reduced heading sizes for narrow sidebar, inline typing indicator without pill background
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** migrated 5 NSPopover controllers (Enum, Set, TypePicker, JSONEditor, ForeignKey) to SwiftUI content views with a shared `PopoverPresenter` utility — eliminates manual `NSEvent` monitors, `NSPopoverDelegate`, and singleton patterns
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `KeyEventHandler` NSViewRepresentable with native `.onKeyPress()` modifiers (macOS 14+) in DatabaseSwitcherSheet and WelcomeWindowView
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced AppKit history panel (5 files: `HistoryPanelController`, `HistoryListViewController`, `QueryPreviewViewController`, `HistoryTableView`, `HistoryRowView`) with single pure SwiftUI `HistoryPanelView` using `HSplitView`, `List` with selection, context menus, and swipe-to-delete
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `ExportTableOutlineView` (NSOutlineView, 757 lines across 2 files) with SwiftUI `ExportTableTreeView` using `List`, `DisclosureGroup`, and tristate checkboxes (~146 lines)
- **Design tokens:** replaced hardcoded `Color.secondary.opacity(0.6)` with system `Color(nsColor: .tertiaryLabelColor)` in `DesignConstants` and `ToolbarDesignTokens` for proper semantic color

### Added

- SQL autocomplete: improved fuzzy match scoring — prefix and contains matches rank above fuzzy-only matches
- Keyboard shortcut customization in Settings > Keyboard — rebind any menu shortcut via press-to-record UI, with conflict detection and "Reset to Defaults" support
- Keyboard shortcut for Switch Connection (`⌘⌥C`) — quickly open the connection switcher popover from the menu or keyboard

### Changed

- **Layout architecture:** replaced `SplitViewMinWidthEnforcer` NSViewRepresentable hack with proper AppDelegate-based inspector split view configuration — eliminates KVO observation, 300ms sleep, and recursive view tree traversal
- **Inspector data flow:** replaced manual snapshot syncing (`syncRightPanelSnapshotData()` + 5 `onChange` handlers) with `InspectorContext` value type passed directly through the view hierarchy via `@Binding`
- **Right panel state:** `RightPanelState` no longer holds snapshot copies of coordinator data or a weak coordinator reference — it now only manages panel visibility, tab state, and owned objects
- **AI chat panel:** receives `currentQuery: String?` parameter instead of a `MainContentCoordinator` reference — better separation of concerns
- **Sidebar save:** replaced `.saveSidebarChanges` notification with direct closure (`RightPanelState.onSave`) set by the notification handler
- Structure tab grid columns now auto-size to fit content on data load
- Structure view column headers and status messages are now localized
- SQL autocomplete: 50ms debounce for completion triggers to reduce unnecessary work

- **PostgreSQL:** DDL tab now includes PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY constraints plus standalone indexes
- **PostgreSQL:** primary key columns are now correctly detected and displayed in the structure grid
- **Security:** escape table and database names in all driver schema queries to prevent SQL injection from names containing special characters
- **SQL editor:** undo/redo (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) now works correctly (was blocked by responder chain selector mismatch)
- **SQL autocomplete:** clause detection now works correctly inside subqueries
- **SQL autocomplete:** block comment detection no longer treats `--` inside `/* */` as a line comment
- **SQL autocomplete:** database-specific type keywords (e.g., PostgreSQL `JSONB`, MySQL `ENUM`) now appear in suggestions
- **SQL autocomplete:** schema suggestions no longer disappear after CREATE TABLE
- **SQL autocomplete:** function completion now inserts `COUNT()` with cursor between parentheses instead of `COUNT(`
- **SQL autocomplete:** RETURNING suggestions now work after INSERT INTO and after closed `VALUES (...)` parentheses
- **SQL autocomplete:** CREATE INDEX ON suggests columns from the referenced table instead of table names
- **SQL autocomplete:** transition keywords (WHERE, JOIN, ORDER BY) no longer buried under columns at clause boundaries
- **SQL autocomplete:** schema-qualified names (e.g., `schema.table.column`) handled correctly

- **SQL generation:** ALTER TABLE, DDL, and SQL Preview statements now consistently end with a semicolon
- **AI chat:** "Ask Each Time" connection policy now shows a confirmation dialog before sending data to AI — previously silently fell through to "Always Allow"

### Removed

### Added

- SQL Preview button (eye icon) in toolbar to review all pending SQL statements before committing changes (⌘⇧P)
