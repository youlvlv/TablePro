# Changelog

All notable changes to TablePro will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog 1.1.0](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Inline dropdown picker when editing ENUM and SET columns, covering MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, ClickHouse, DuckDB, and MongoDB JSON-schema enums (#1283)
- Filter rows show an enum dropdown for `=` and `!=` operators on enum columns (#1283)
- CSV/TSV inspector: open files from Finder or File > Open, edit cells, multi-condition filter (Cmd+F), multi-column sort (shift-click headers), add/remove/rename columns with type override, copy/paste rows as TSV, undo/redo, auto-reload on external changes. Large files stream from disk without loading into memory. (#1259)
- iOS: SQL Server (MSSQL) connections via FreeTDS over TDS 7.4. Uses the shared `SSLConfiguration` model from connection settings. Supports connect, query, streaming results, schema browsing (tables, columns, indexes, foreign keys), database and schema switching, and explicit transactions.
- iOS: data browser, search, filter, and pagination now render correct SQL Server syntax (bracket-quoted identifiers, `OFFSET ... ROWS FETCH NEXT ... ROWS ONLY` pagination, `SELECT TOP 1` for cell value fetch).
- iOS: Settings > Sync now shows last sync time, a Sync Now button, and a Refresh from iCloud action that re-downloads every connection, group, and tag when items are missing on this device but visible on another.

### Changed

- Drivers populate allowed enum values directly in column metadata instead of parsing them downstream
- PluginKit ABI bumped to version 13; all registry plugins need to be re-tagged

## [0.42.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- CockroachDB support over the PostgreSQL wire protocol, with a Connection Options field for libpq routing (#1226)
- AI Chat: OpenAI Responses API for GPT-5 and Codex with a collapsible Thinking panel, reasoning effort picker, curated model picker, strict tool schemas by default, and image input via paste or drop (HEIC/TIFF/BMP converted, EXIF/GPS stripped) (#1112)
- AI Chat: Claude extended thinking on Opus 4.7, Sonnet 4.6, and Haiku 4.5 (#1112)
- iOS: SQL Server connections via FreeTDS over TDS 7.4, including data browser, search, filter, and pagination with SQL Server syntax
- iOS: Settings > Sync shows last sync time with Sync Now and Refresh from iCloud
- Settings > Data Grid > Default row sort opens tables sorted by primary key or first column (#1284)

### Changed

- Database switcher is now a toolbar popover with active-row checkmark, search, Refresh, and an engine-aware New Database footer (⌘N and ⌘R bound globally)
- New Database and Drop Database use native sheet and confirmation dialogs

### Security

- AI Chat: destructive operations (DROP, TRUNCATE, ALTER...DROP) always prompt for approval; Silent mode and Always Allow no longer bypass the check

### Fixed

- AI Chat: Gemini tool calls no longer fail with 400, `thoughtSignature` round-trips after tool runs, and DeepSeek V4 thinking is captured across turns
- AI Chat: GitHub Copilot tool registration accepts optional fields
- MySQL/MariaDB: `BIT(N)` columns display as decimal numbers instead of raw bytes (#1272)
- Structure tab: Refresh and ⌘R show external schema changes on Columns, DDL, and ClickHouse Parts (#1281)
- Query editor: Enter and ⌘+Enter work after accepting an autocomplete suggestion, and double-click no longer closes the window (#1278)
- Query editor autocomplete reflects external column renames after Refresh
- ClickHouse, BigQuery, CloudflareD1, LibSQL, Etcd, and DynamoDB: long-running queries honor Settings > Query timeout instead of failing at 30 seconds (#1267)
- MongoDB: connection form shows the Username field so auth-enabled servers stop failing with "requires authentication"
- MongoDB: deleting a host from the multi-host editor keeps the list interactive (#1293)
- SQL import: PostgreSQL dollar-quoted function bodies parse correctly, and statements are no longer dropped when the database is slower than the parser (#1264)
- SQL export: views, materialized views, and foreign tables emit the matching `DROP` (#1264)
- iOS: connections, groups, and tags survive TestFlight and App Store updates

### Removed

- Help > Report an Issue; the menu item opens GitHub Issues in a browser

## [0.41.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- File > Backup Dump… and Restore Dump… for PostgreSQL and Redshift, with live progress, cancel, and SSH tunnel reuse (#1211).

### Changed

- Plugin format updated. Older plugin builds no longer load; reinstall plugins from the registry after updating.

### Fixed

- Redis: "Required (skip verify)" SSL mode now actually skips certificate verification, so Upstash and other untrusted-CA endpoints connect (#1247).
- MSSQL: SSL mode setting now affects the connection. Previously every mode was silently ignored.
- MongoDB: "Required" and "Verify CA" SSL modes connect to self-signed and untrusted-CA servers instead of failing.
- MongoDB: connecting no longer crashes with `dispatch_sync called on queue already owned by current thread` (#1249).
- MongoDB: TLS handshake to Atlas no longer fails with `internal error (-9838)` on macOS 26.
- MongoDB: importing a connection URL with no database path now works for Atlas users restricted to one database.
- MySQL: CA certificate is no longer loaded when the SSL mode skips verification, matching PostgreSQL.

## [0.40.3] - 2026-05-13

### Fixed

- AI Chat: scrolling stays smooth on long conversations and stream completion no longer briefly hides the chat. (#1239)
- AI Chat: starting a new conversation no longer carries context from the previous one.
- PostgreSQL: connecting to servers older than 9.3 no longer fails on schema load. (#1240)
- MySQL: EXPLAIN now offers a plain variant that works on every version.

- Cassandra: connecting to a 2.x server now shows a clear unsupported-version message instead of failing on sidebar load.
- MongoDB: connecting to servers older than 3.4 no longer fails on the database listing.
- ClickHouse: the index sidebar no longer fails on versions older than 19.17.

## [0.40.2] - 2026-05-12

### Added

- Right-click Set Value on date, datetime, and timestamp cells now offers `CURRENT_DATE`, `CURRENT_TIME`, `NOW()`, and `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP`, filtered by column type.
- Welcome screen left pane gains an Import from Other App button.

### Changed

- Row numbers in the data grid continue across pages and the `#` column auto-sizes to fit the widest visible number.
- Date, datetime, and timestamp cells use the standard inline text editor; the popover date picker is removed.
- Foreign key preview popover follows the selected row as you arrow up or down.
- The connection window shows the connecting state inline with a Cancel button.

### Fixed

- Closing the connection window during a slow connect no longer leaves a stuck "Connecting…" window or a stray failure alert (#1185).
- Cmd+Z while editing a cell now undoes typing in the editor; pressing it after dismissing the editor no longer crashes.
- Cmd+Z right after Add Row no longer leaves a stranded editor floating over the removed row.
- Editing a NULL cell and dismissing without typing no longer flips the value to an empty string.
- Double-clicking another cell while editing no longer delays the new editor or drops pending changes on the previous one.
- Double-clicking an enum, set, or boolean cell now opens the inline text editor; the chevron still opens the picker popover.
- Chevron-accessory cells (enum, boolean, JSON, blob) no longer truncate short values that fit the full cell width.
- DATE columns no longer render a phantom `00:00:00` time suffix.
- Adding a new row no longer renders the row on top of the auto-opened cell editor mid-animation.

## [0.40.1] - 2026-05-12

### Changed

- Quick Switcher matches the Open Database dialog and shows a Recent section per connection.
- Connection Switcher and SQL Preview open as sheets so they work from the toolbar, overflow menu, and keyboard shortcuts.
- Filters button moved out of the toolbar; the bottom-bar Filters control remains.
- Welcome screen drops the Import Connections button; both import flows remain in the + menu.

### Fixed

- Toolbar overflow menu entries now fire their action when the window is narrowed.
- SQL Preview no longer freezes when previewing a very large batch.
- Quick Switcher crash on macOS 26.
- Registry updates for bundled drivers (ClickHouse, Redis) now persist after restart.

## [0.39.1] - 2026-05-08

### Added

- AI Chat: tool calling with per-card approval, Ask / Edit / Agent modes, and 7 providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, OpenRouter, Gemini, Ollama, GitHub Copilot, custom OpenAI-compatible)

### Fixed

- App fails to launch on 0.39.0 with errno 163 "Launchd job spawn failed". Production entitlements shipped a literal `$(AppIdentifierPrefix)` placeholder in `keychain-access-groups` because `codesign --entitlements` does not expand Xcode build variables. Reverted to the hardcoded team prefix; personal-team contributors still use `TablePro.Debug.entitlements` (#1104)
- "MariaDB plugin not installed" prompt for built-in lazy drivers
- Cmd+K Quick Switcher schema selection on SQL Server and Oracle
- iOS: crash opening some MySQL tables

## [0.38.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added

- Welcome window: "Check for Updates" link next to the version number
- Window menu: dedicated Integrations Activity window for the MCP activity log and connected clients. Sidebar, native search, filter, refresh, export. Position remembered across launches
- Sample database (Chinook) bundled. Open from welcome screen with one click; reset via File menu
- Connection string detection: paste a `postgres://`, `mysql://`, `redis://`, or `mongodb://` URL to auto-fill the form
- MCP: protocol versions `2025-06-18` and `2025-11-25` (in addition to `2025-03-26`). Includes structured tool output (`structuredContent`), tool annotations (`readOnlyHint`, `destructiveHint`, etc.), `completions` capability, and streaming progress notifications via `notifications/progress`
- MCP: pairing redirect carries `error=denied` when the user clicks Deny
- MCP: re-pairing the same client name revokes the previous token
- Oracle 10G password verifier auth, matching DBeaver/JDBC/sqlplus (#483)
- Oracle Test Connection: diagnostic sheet on auth failure with copy-able info, suggested actions, and an issue link
- Oracle connection negotiation matches python-oracledb 23ai (TTC4 boundary, TTC5 token/pipelining/sessionless, OCI3 sync, dequeue selectors, sparse vectors)
- SSH tunnel resolves `~/.ssh/config` host aliases at connection time, with full `ssh_config(5)` semantics: glob `Host` patterns, all `Match` types, `ProxyJump`, hostname canonicalization, `Include`. Live (no app restart). Applies to primary host and jump hosts (#977)

### Changed

- Welcome window aligned to macOS HIG: subtle drop shadow on the app icon (no accent glow), dynamic text styles, "Sponsor" button removed, "Create connection" uses the bordered style, toolbar `+` / new-group buttons gain a hover background, native window vibrancy via `NSVisualEffectView`
- Settings > Integrations is a flat preferences pane per macOS HIG. Activity log and connected-clients moved to the new Integrations Activity window; setup snippets to a "Connect a Client…" sheet
- MCP: idle session timeout 5 → 15 minutes
- MCP: server, stdio bridge, and protocol dispatcher rewritten for spec compliance. Public API of `MCPServerManager` and the on-disk handshake format unchanged; clients do not need to re-pair
- Security: non-syncing keychain items use `kSecAttrAccessibleAfterFirstUnlockThisDeviceOnly`. Keeps local-only secrets out of unencrypted device backups. Existing items keep their accessibility class until you re-save
- Settings > Sync > Passwords: caption clarifies the toggle only affects new saves

### Removed

- SSH `useSSHConfig` per-connection toggle. `~/.ssh/config` is always consulted now; explicit form values still take precedence
- Legacy-keychain migration and password-sync-state migration. Both violated Apple's Data Protection keychain contract on sandboxed macOS and corrupted credentials. Stale items in the legacy keychain can be cleaned via Keychain Access

### Fixed

- Welcome / connection form / feedback panel now remember position and size across launches (frame autosave was missing on the underlying `NSWindow`/`NSPanel`)
- Saved connection passwords no longer disappear after relaunch. The legacy-keychain migration was deleting the only copy on sandboxed macOS; removed entirely
- Cmd+Z after editing a cell now clears the yellow "modified" highlight (the coordinator's `dataTabDelegate` was being nilled too eagerly)
- Tab switching: rapid Cmd+Number no longer leaves a tail of tab transitions after key release. AppKit switches now apply synchronously via `NSAnimationContext` with `duration = 0`
- Oracle: TIMESTAMP variants, INTERVAL DAY TO SECOND, INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH, DATE, RAW, and BLOB render through typed decoders. INTERVAL YEAR TO MONTH and BFILE no longer crash on row fetch. Unknown types show `<unsupported: type>` instead of crashing (#965)
- Oracle: 23ai cloud and container handshakes no longer fail with `uncleanShutdown`. OOB urgent-byte send now requires `TNS_ACCEPT_FLAG_CHECK_OOB` advertisement (#483)
- Plugin install prompt reopens when connecting to a downloadable database type whose plugin is disabled or uninstalled (#975)
- Redshift: schema switcher no longer empty for non-admin users. Reads from `pg_namespace` filtered by `has_schema_privilege` instead of `information_schema.schemata` (#971)
- MCP: GET `/mcp` opens a real SSE notification stream
- MCP: concurrent tool calls no longer serialize at the dispatcher loop
- MCP: server validates `protocolVersion` and `MCP-Protocol-Version`; rejects unknown versions with `-32600 invalid_request`
- MCP: 429 responses include a real `Retry-After` header from the rate-limiter lockout
- MCP: token revocation cancels in-flight requests and terminates sessions
- MCP: CORS reflects the request `Origin` against an allowlist (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, `claude.ai`, `app.cursor.com`)
- MCP: stale `Mcp-Session-Id` after idle timeout returns JSON-RPC `-32001 "Session not found"` with HTTP 404, letting clients re-initialize cleanly instead of hanging until a 4-minute client timeout
- MCP: stdio bridge uses `FileHandle.bytes` AsyncBytes (no more silent exit on briefly empty stdin)
- MCP: SSE responses stream incrementally instead of buffering
- MCP: rate limiter keys on `(client_address, principal_fingerprint)` to close localhost auth-DoS
- MCP: in-app setup snippets use the stdio command form for `tablepro-mcp` (Claude Desktop rejected the URL form)
- MCP: duplicate `initialize` returns `invalid_request` instead of overwriting `clientInfo`
- MCP: `xcodebuild test` no longer leaves an orphan `TablePro.app` running
- MCP: server start cleans stale handshake file from a crashed previous PID
- MCP: activity log auto-refreshes when new audit entries are written

## [0.37.0] - 2026-05-01

### Added

- External API for Raycast, Cursor, Claude Desktop, and other MCP clients. New Integrations panel with token-based pairing (PKCE), per-connection access control, and a 90-day activity log
- New MCP tools: `list_recent_tabs`, `search_query_history`, `open_connection_window`, `open_table_tab`, `focus_query_tab`
- Per-connection External Access setting (`blocked` / `readOnly` / `readWrite`); effective scope is the minimum of token scope and connection level
- PostgreSQL ICU collation provider in Create Database (PG 15+)
- Connection URL parsing supports SSH `user:password@host`, multi-host, MongoDB auth params, and Redis database index
- SSH Private Key auth auto-resolves keys from `~/.ssh/config` and default locations (`id_ed25519`, `id_rsa`, `id_ecdsa`)
- Single-click cell editing in the data grid (no more double-click)
- Multi-cell paste from TSV clipboard data, grouped as one undo
- Shift+Tab navigates to the previous cell
- Copy rows in TSV, HTML table, and plain text for richer paste in spreadsheet apps
- AI provider settings allow manually entering a model name when the provider does not return one
- VoiceOver: column headers announce sort direction and priority; cells expose row and column index ranges

### Changed

- Result safety cap is enforced after the query runs, not by rewriting your SQL. When a result is capped, the status bar shows "Showing N rows (truncated)" with a Fetch All button. Load More on user-query tabs is removed; table-tab pagination is unchanged
- MCP server lazy-starts on first external request; manual enable is gone
- Settings tab renamed from "MCP" to "Integrations" with sections for connected clients, activity log, and pairing
- Activity log gained an Export button that writes the current filtered list to CSV
- Connection Advanced settings: AI Policy and External Clients share a single External Access section with a segmented control
- Create Database is driver-driven; engines without creation support hide the Create button instead of failing on click
- Data grid: persistent column reuse pool, SF Symbol sort indicators that respect light and dark mode, header divider taps trigger resize instead of sort, focus ring follows system accent
- Data grid undo/redo uses the window's UndoManager, unifying Cmd+Z across editor and grid
- Right-click during cell editing shows the native text context menu instead of the row menu
- OpenSSL shared as dylib across app and plugins, reducing bundle size by ~15MB

### Removed (BREAKING)

- Old name-based deep links (`tablepro://connect/{name}/...`) are gone. Use UUID-keyed paths from "Copy Connection Deep Link" in the sidebar context menu; saved bookmarks must be regenerated
- MCP server data directory moved from `~/Library/Application Support/com.TablePro/` to `~/Library/Application Support/TablePro/`. Re-pair external clients after upgrading. Delete the old directory with `rm -rf ~/Library/Application\ Support/com.TablePro`
- Separately distributed plugins (Oracle, DuckDB, MSSQL, MongoDB, BigQuery, LibSQL, Cassandra, Etcd, Cloudflare D1, DynamoDB) require update before use. PluginKit ABI bumped to 9
- Settings renamed: `enforceQueryResultLimit` is now `truncateQueryResults`, `queryResultLimit` is now `queryResultRowCap`. Custom values revert to defaults on first launch

### Fixed

- SELECT queries with a user-written LIMIT now return the requested row count. The query engine no longer strips your LIMIT and substitutes its own cap, so `LIMIT 10` returns 10 rows. Affected SQLite, DuckDB, LibSQL, ClickHouse, Redshift, Cloudflare D1, and the MCP query path. MSSQL and Oracle no longer silently inject `ORDER BY 1` either (#956)
- Crash on macOS 26 when opening SQL Preview
- File associations for `.sql`, `.sqlite`, `.duckdb` now appear in Finder's Open With menu
- New tab from the empty state replaces the placeholder instead of opening a side-by-side tab
- PostgreSQL Create Database collation errors on glibc-initialized servers (#927)
- Redshift Create Database emits valid `COLLATE { CASE_SENSITIVE | CASE_INSENSITIVE }` instead of PostgreSQL `LC_COLLATE` syntax
- SSH agent and `IdentityAgent` socket paths now expand `~` so 1Password and similar agents work
- Connection form `usePrivateKey=true` from URL no longer disables Test and Create buttons
- Transient connections from URL clean up keychain entries on connection failure
- Native Search Field focus regression when clearing text
- Group and connection deletions persist before firing the sync notification, fixing a race that could re-upload deleted records to iCloud
- MCP `execute_query`: trailing semicolons no longer break appended LIMIT/OFFSET
- Pairing approval: 5-minute countdown timer, searchable connection list, can no longer grant via Return key, requires explicit Approve click
- Token deletion and client disconnect now require confirmation
- Activity log: searchable across action, token, connection, and details; connection name shown instead of UUID prefix; single scroll owner
- Token, audit, and pairing sheets respect Dynamic Type and dark mode; warning banner stays visible in dark mode
- Token list switched to a native list with keyboard navigation, multi-select, and a context menu (Revoke, Copy ID, Delete)
- "Last used" timestamps use RelativeDateTimeFormatter for correct localization
- Refuse to generate SQL when the database dialect cannot be resolved, instead of silently emitting unquoted identifiers

- MongoDB tab name showing "MQL Query" instead of collection name when using bracket notation `db["collection"].find()`

## [0.11.0] - 2026-03-02

### Added

- Environment color indicator: subtle toolbar tint based on connection color for at-a-glance environment identification
- Import database connections from SSH tunnel URLs (e.g., `mysql+ssh://`, `postgresql+ssh://`)
- Connection groups for organizing database connections into folders with colored headers

### Fixed

- Toolbar briefly showing "MySQL" and missing version (e.g., "MongoDB" instead of "MongoDB 8.2.5") when opening a new tab
- Keyboard shortcuts not working (beep sound) after connecting from welcome screen until a second tab is opened
- Toolbar overflow menu showing only one item and missing all other buttons when window is narrow

- PostgreSQL schema switching via ⌘K database switcher (browse and switch between schemas like `public`, `auth`, custom schemas)

### Changed

- Replace DispatchQueue.main.asyncAfter chains in AppDelegate startup with structured Task-based retry loops
- Merge 3 identical Combine notification subscriptions in SidebarViewModel into Publishers.Merge3
- Make AIChatStorage encoder/decoder static — shared across all instances instead of duplicated

### Fixed

- Cell edit showing modified background but displaying original value until save (reloadData during active editing ignored by NSTableView, updateNSView blocked by editedRow guard)
- Undo on inserted row cell edit not syncing insertedRowData (stale values after undo)
- Vim Escape key not exiting Insert/Visual mode when autocomplete popup is visible (popup's event monitor consumed the key)
- Copy (Cmd+C) and Cut (Cmd+X) not working in SQL editor — clipboard retained old value due to CodeEditTextView's copy: silently failing
- Vim yank/delete operations not syncing to system clipboard (register only stored text internally)
- Vim word motions (`w`, `b`, `e`) using two-class word boundary detection instead of correct three-class (word chars, punctuation, whitespace)
- Vim visual mode selection now correctly includes cursor character (inclusive selection matching real Vim behavior)
- Arrow keys now work in Vim visual/normal mode (mapped to h/j/k/l instead of bypassing the Vim engine)
- Vim block cursor now follows the moving end of the selection in visual mode instead of staying at the anchor
- Vim visual mode selection highlight now renders visibly (trigger needsDisplay after programmatic selection)
- Fix event monitor leaks in SQL editor — `deinit` now cleans up NSEvent monitors, notification observers, and work items that leaked when CodeEditSourceEditor never called `destroy()`
- Fix unbounded memory growth from NativeTabRegistry holding full QueryTab objects (including RowBuffer references) — registry now stores lightweight TabSnapshot structs
- Fix SortedRowsCache storing full row copies — now stores index permutations only, halving sorted-tab memory
- Fix schema provider memory leak — shared providers are now reference-counted with 5s grace period removal when all windows for a connection close
- Fix duplicate schema fetches in InlineSuggestionManager — now shares the coordinator's SQLSchemaProvider instead of maintaining a separate cache
- Fix background tabs retaining full result data indefinitely — RowBuffer eviction frees memory for inactive tabs (re-fetched on switch back)
- Fix InMemoryRowProvider bulk cache eviction — now uses proximity-based eviction keeping entries near current scroll position
- Fix stale tabRowProviders entries when tab IDs change without count changing
- Fix crash on macOS 14.x caused by `_strchrnul` symbol not found in libpq.5.dylib — switch libpq and OpenSSL from dynamic Homebrew linking to vendored static libraries built with MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET=14.0
- Fix duplicate tabs and lag when inserting SQL from AI Chat or History panel with multiple window-tabs open — notification handlers now only fire in the key window
- Fix "Run in New Tab" race condition in History panel — replaced fragile two-notification + 100ms delay pattern with a single atomic notification
- Fix MainContentCoordinator deinit Task that may never execute — added explicit teardown() method with didTeardown guard and orphaned schema provider purge
- Fix SQLEditorCoordinator deinit deferring InlineSuggestionManager cleanup to Task — added explicit destroy() lifecycle and didDestroy guard with warning log
- Fix ExportService while-true batch loops not checking Task.isCancelled — cancelled exports now stop promptly instead of running all remaining batches
- Fix DataGridView full column reconfiguration on every resultVersion bump — narrowed rebuild condition to only trigger when transitioning from empty state
- Fix ConnectionHealthMonitor fixed 30s interval that delays failure detection — added checkNow() with wakeUpContinuation for immediate health checks and exponential backoff
- Fix HistoryPanelView and TableStructureView asyncAfter copy-reset timers not cancellable — replaced with cancellable Task pattern
- Fix MainContentView redundant onChange handler causing cascading re-renders on tab/table changes
- Fix DatabaseManager notification observer creating unnecessary Tasks when self is already deallocated — added guard let self before Task creation

## [0.8.0] - 2026-02-27

### Changed

- Refactored sidebar table list to MVVM architecture with testable SidebarViewModel
- Extracted TableRow and context menu into separate files (TableRowView.swift, SidebarContextMenu.swift)
- Migrated to native macOS window tabs (`NSWindow` tabbing) — tab bar is now rendered by macOS itself, identical to Finder/Safari/Xcode tabs with automatic dark/light mode support, drag-to-reorder, and "Merge All Windows" for free
- Each tab is a full independent window with its own sidebar, editor, and state — no more shared tab manager or ZStack keep-alive pattern
- New Tab (Cmd+T) creates a native macOS window tab; Close Tab (Cmd+W) closes the native tab
- Tab switching (Cmd+Shift+[/], Cmd+1-9) now uses native macOS tab navigation
- Sidebar table selection is per-window-tab (independent of other tabs)
- Tab persistence now saves/restores combined state from all native window tabs via NativeTabRegistry; restored tabs reopen as individual native window tabs
- Sidebar table click navigates in-place when no unsaved changes; opens new native tab when dirty
- FK navigation follows the same in-place/new-tab behavior based on unsaved changes
- "Show All Tables" now opens metadata query in a new native tab instead of appending to the current window
- Create Table success closes the create-table window and opens the new table in a fresh native tab
- Window title updates dynamically after navigate-in-place (sidebar click, FK navigation)

### Fixed

- Sidebar loses keyboard focus (arrow key navigation) after opening a second table tab
- Sidebar active state flash and loss when clicking a table that opens in a new native window tab — removed the async revert; each window now re-syncs its sidebar via `NSWindow.didBecomeKeyNotification`, and programmatic syncs skip navigation via an early-return guard
- Sidebar loses active state when opening a second table in a new native window tab — `handleTabSelectionChange` now calls `syncSidebarToCurrentTab()` so the new window's empty `localSelectedTables` is seeded from the restored tab
- Sidebar now refreshes immediately after switching databases via Cmd+K — clears `session.tables` during the switch so `SidebarView.onChange` triggers `loadTables()` against the new database without requiring a manual refresh
- Cmd+W in empty state (after all tabs are cleared) now closes the connection window and disconnects, instead of doing nothing
- Fix Cmd+K database switch flooding all windows with error alerts — `.refreshAll` broadcast caused every window to re-execute its table query against the wrong database; now only the current tab re-executes, and only if its table exists in the new database
- Fix clicking a table in the sidebar replacing the current tab instead of opening a new native tab
- Fix clicking a table from a query tab overwriting the SQL editor instead of opening a separate table tab
- Tab persistence no longer overwrites combined state from all windows when a single window saves — uses NativeTabRegistry for combined state
- Query text editing in one window no longer corrupts other windows' persisted tab state
- Fix Cmd+W on any tab disconnecting the session and showing welcome screen — now only disconnects when the last main window is closed
- Fix Cmd+T from empty state creating two native tabs instead of one — now adds a query tab to the current window
- Fix clicking a table in the sidebar from empty state not opening the table — now creates a table tab in the current window
- Fix native tab title showing "SQL Query" instead of the table name when opening a table from empty state
- Fix Cmd+W on the last tab disconnecting the session instead of returning to empty state

### Removed

- Removed broken SidebarFocusRestorer (non-functional NSViewRepresentable focus hack)
- Removed dead code: unused onTablePro callback, single-table toggle methods
- Custom AppKit tab bar (NativeTabBarView) — replaced by native macOS window tab bar
- Removed vestigial multi-tab code: `performDirectTabSwitch`, `skipNextTabChangeOnChange`, `tabPendingChanges`, `tabSelectionCache`, `lastFlushTime`, `filterStateSavedExternally`, `flushSelectionCache`, `duplicateTab`, `togglePin`, `selectTab`, `switchToDatabase` (legacy)

### Performance

- Cache SQLSchemaProvider per connection so new native tabs reuse the already-loaded schema instead of re-fetching tables and columns from the database (saves 500ms-2s per tab)
- Schema loading now runs in background, no longer blocks the data query from starting — table data appears immediately while autocomplete schema loads concurrently
- Remove unconditional 100ms sleep in `waitForConnectionAndExecute` when connection is already established
- Defer `loadTableMetadataIfNeeded` until after the tab's first query completes, avoiding a redundant DB round-trip during tab initialization
- Replace `@ObservedObject dbManager` in ContentView with targeted `@State` + `onReceive` — eliminates O(N) view cascade where every window re-rendered on any DatabaseManager state change
- Remove `@StateObject dbManager` from TableProApp — prevents app-level body re-evaluation on every DatabaseManager publish
- Batch `connectToSession` session mutations into a single `activeSessions` write — reduces 5 separate `objectWillChange` publishes to 1
- Remove redundant `DatabaseManager.updateSession` calls in tab change handlers — NativeTabRegistry already handles persistence, eliminating unnecessary `@Published` cascades
- Add initialization guard to `initializeAndRestoreTabs` preventing duplicate query execution from racing `.task` and `onChange(of: selectedTabId)` paths
- Replace `onChange(of: DatabaseManager.shared.currentSession?.*)` with per-window `onReceive` filtered by connection ID — stops SwiftUI from tracking the global DatabaseManager singleton as a dependency
- Guard health monitor status writes to skip no-op `.connected` → `.connected` transitions — eliminates idle 30-second cascade on all windows
- Extract all menu commands into `AppMenuCommands` struct — `AppState` changes now only re-evaluate menu items, not the Scene body / all WindowGroups
- Add `isContentViewEquivalent(to:)` comparison on `ConnectionSession` — skips `@State` writes when only `tabs`, `selectedTabId`, or `lastActiveAt` changed, preventing O(N) MainContentView.init cascade across windows

## [0.7.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added

- Quick search and filter rows can now be combined — when both are active, their WHERE conditions are joined with AND
- Foreign key columns now show a navigation arrow icon in each cell — click to open the referenced table filtered by the FK value

### Changed

- Metadata queries (columns, FKs, row count) now run on a dedicated parallel connection, eliminating 200-300ms delay for FK arrows and pagination count on initial table load
- Approximate row count from database metadata displays instantly with data; exact count refines silently in the background
- Show warning indicator on filter presets referencing columns not in current table
- Increase filter row height estimate for better accessibility support
- FK navigation now uses dedicated FilterStateManager.setFKFilter API instead of direct property manipulation
- Add syntax highlighting to Import SQL file preview
- XLSX export now enforces the Excel row limit (1,048,576) per sheet and uses autoreleasepool per row to reduce peak memory during large exports
- Multiline cell values now use a scrollable overlay editor instead of the constrained field editor, enabling proper vertical scrolling and line navigation during inline editing
- AnyChangeManager now uses a reference-type box for lazy initialization, avoiding Combine pipeline creation during SwiftUI body evaluation
- DataGridView identity check moved before AppSettingsManager read to skip settings access when nothing has changed
- DataGridView async column width write-back now uses an isWritingColumnLayout guard to prevent two-frame bounce
- Tab switch flushPendingSave debounced to skip redundant saves within 100ms of rapid tab switching
- SQL editor frame-change notification throttled to 50ms to avoid redundant syntax highlight viewport recalculation on every keystroke
- SQL editor text binding sync now uses O(1) NSString length pre-check before O(n) full string equality comparison
- Toolbar executing state now fires a single objectWillChange instead of double-publishing isExecuting and connectionState
- Row provider onChange handlers coalesced into a single trigger to avoid redundant InMemoryRowProvider rebuilds
- SQL import now uses file-size estimation instead of a separate counting pass, eliminating the double-parse overhead for large files
- History cleanup COUNT + DELETE now wrapped in a single transaction to reduce journal flushes
- SQLite `fetchTableMetadata` now caps row count scan at 100k rows to avoid full table scans on large tables
- SQLite `fetchIndexes` uses table-valued pragma functions in a single query instead of N+1 separate PRAGMA calls
- MySQL empty-result DESCRIBE fallback now only triggers for SELECT queries, avoiding redundant round-trips for non-SELECT statements
- Remove redundant `String(query)` copy in MariaDB query execution
- MySQL result fetching now uses `mysql_use_result` (streaming) instead of `mysql_store_result` (full buffering), so only the capped row count is held in memory instead of the entire server result set
- Instant pagination via approximate row count — MySQL/PostgreSQL tables now show "~N rows" immediately with data, then refine to exact count in background
- QueryTab uses value-based equality for SwiftUI diffing, eliminating unnecessary ForEach re-renders on tab array writes
- Cached static regex for `extractTableName`, `SQLiteDriver.stripLimitOffset`, and SQL function expressions to avoid per-call compilation
- Static NumberFormatter in status bar to avoid per-render locale resolution
- Batch `TableProTabSmart` field writes into single array store to avoid 14 CoW copies per query execution
- Tab persistence writes moved off main thread via `Task.detached`
- Single history entry per SQL import instead of per-statement recording
- WAL mode enabled for query history SQLite database
- Merged `fetchDatabaseMetadata` into single query for MySQL and PostgreSQL
- Health ping now uses dedicated metadata driver to avoid blocking user queries
- SSH tunnel setup extracted into shared helper to eliminate code duplication
- PostgreSQL DDL queries restructured with `async let` for cleaner dispatch (sequential on serial connection queue)
- Cancel query connection now uses 5-second connect timeout
- PostgreSQL connection parameters properly escaped for special characters
- SQLite `fetchAllColumns` overridden with single `sqlite_master` + `pragma_table_info` query
- Eliminated intermediate `[UInt8]` buffer in MySQL and PostgreSQL field extraction
- Column layout sync gated behind user-resize flag to skip O(n) loop on cursor moves
- Column width calculation uses monospace character arithmetic instead of per-row CoreText calls
- DataChangeManager maintains change index incrementally instead of full O(n) rebuild
- JSON export buffers writes per row instead of per field
- `SQLFormatterService` uses NSMutableString for keyword uppercasing and integer counter for placeholders
- SQLContextAnalyzer uses single alternation regex and single-pass state machine for string/comment detection
- `escapeJSONString` iterates UTF-8 bytes instead of grapheme clusters
- `AppSettingsStorage` caches JSONDecoder/JSONEncoder as stored properties
- `AppSettingsManager` stores validated settings in memory after didSet
- `FilterSettingsStorage` uses tracked key set instead of loading full plist
- Keychain saves use `SecItemAdd` + `SecItemUpdate` upsert pattern instead of delete + add
- Autocomplete `detectFunctionContext` uses index tracking instead of character-by-character string building

### Fixed

- Fix AND/OR filter logic mode ignored in query execution — preview showed correct OR logic but actual query always used AND
- Fix filter panel state (filters, visibility, quick search, logic mode) not preserved when switching between tabs
- Fix foreign key navigation filter being wiped when switching to a new tab (tab switch restore overwrote FK filter state)
- Fix pagination count appearing 200-300ms after data loads — approximate row count from database metadata now displays instantly with data, exact count refines silently in the background
- Fix foreign key navigation arrows and pagination count appearing with visible delay on initial table load — metadata now fetches on a dedicated parallel connection concurrent with the main query
- Fix LibPQ parameterized query using Swift `deallocate()` for `strdup`-allocated memory instead of `free()`
- FTS5 search input now sanitized to prevent parse errors from special characters like \*, OR, AND

- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export failing to import when types/sequences already exist (`DROP IF EXISTS` now always emitted for dependent types and sequences)
- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export missing `CREATE TYPE` definitions for enum columns, causing import errors
- Fix PostgreSQL DDL tab not showing enum type definitions used by table columns
- Fix compilation error for PostgreSQL dependent sequences export (`fetchDependentSequences` missing from `DatabaseDriver` protocol)
- Fix PostgreSQL LIKE/NOT LIKE expressions missing `ESCAPE '\'` clause, causing wildcard escaping (`\%`, `\_`) to be treated as literal characters
- Fix SQLite regex filter silently degrading to LIKE substring match instead of being excluded from the WHERE clause

## [0.6.4] - 2026-02-23

- Fix PostgreSQL SQL export failing to fetch DDL for tables (passed quoted identifier instead of raw table name to catalog queries)

## [0.6.3] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Extract shared `performDirectTabSwitch` into `MainContentCoordinator` to eliminate duplicate tab-switch logic
- Welcome window now uses native macOS frosted glass translucency (NSVisualEffectView with behind-window blending)

- Improved tab switching performance by caching row providers and change managers across SwiftUI render cycles
- Eliminated selection sync feedback loop causing redundant DataGridView updates during tab switch
- Enabled NSTableView row view recycling to reduce heap allocations during scrolling
- Reduced SwiftUI re-render cascades by batching @Published mutations during tab switch

## [0.6.2] - 2026-02-23

### Changed

- Replace generic SwiftUI colors with native macOS system colors (`Color(nsColor: .system*)` instead of `Color.red/green/blue/orange`) for proper dark mode, vibrancy, and accessibility adaptation
- Replace hardcoded opacity on semantic colors with `quaternaryLabelColor`/`tertiaryLabelColor`
- Use `shadowColor` instead of `Color.black` for shadows
- Replace iOS-style Capsule badges with RoundedRectangle

## [0.6.1] - 2026-02-23

    - **I/O:** Throttled history cleanup (IO-1), async history storage migration (IO-2), consolidated onChange handlers (IO-3)

## [0.6.0] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- Inline AI suggestions (ghost text) in the SQL editor — auto-triggers on typing pause, Tab to accept, Escape to dismiss
- Schema-aware inline suggestions — AI now uses actual table/column names from the connected database (cached with 30s TTL, respects `includeSchema` and `maxSchemaTables` settings)
- AI feature highlight row on onboarding features page
- Added VoiceOver accessibility labels to custom controls: data grid (table view, column headers, cells), filter panel (logic toggle, presets, action buttons, filter row controls), toolbar buttons (connection switcher, database switcher, refresh, export, import, filter toggle, history toggle, inspector toggle), editor tab bar (tab items, close buttons, add tab button), and sidebar (table/view rows, search clear button)

### Changed

- Migrated notification observers in `MainContentCommandActions` from Combine publishers (`.publisher(for:).sink`) to async sequences (`for await` over `NotificationCenter.default.notifications(named:)`) — removes `AnyCancellable` storage in favor of `Task` handles with proper cancellation on deinit
- Migrated tab state persistence from UserDefaults to file-based storage in Application Support — prevents large JSON payloads from bloating the plist loaded at app launch, with automatic one-time migration of existing data
- Refactored menu and toolbar commands from NotificationCenter to `@FocusedObject` pattern — menu commands and toolbar buttons now call `MainContentCommandActions` methods directly instead of posting global notifications, with context-aware routing for structure view operations
- Redesigned connection form with tab-based layout (General / SSH Tunnel / SSL/TLS / Advanced), replacing the single-scroll layout
- Revamped connection form UI to use native macOS grouped form style (`Form`/`.formStyle(.grouped)`) with `LabeledContent` for automatic label-value alignment and `Section` headers — replacing the previous hand-rolled `VStack` layout with custom `FormField` component
- Removed unused `FormField` component and helper methods (`iconForType`, `colorForType`)
- SQLite connections now only show General and Advanced tabs (SSH/SSL hidden)
- Added async/await wrapper methods to `QueryHistoryStorage` — existing completion-handler API preserved for compatibility, new `async` overloads use `withCheckedContinuation` for modern Swift concurrency callers

### Fixed

- Fixed TOCTOU race condition in `SQLiteDriver` — replaced `nonisolated(unsafe)` + DispatchQueue pattern with a dedicated actor (`SQLiteConnectionActor`) that serializes all sqlite3 handle access, preventing concurrent task races on the connection state
- Consolidated multiple `.sheet(isPresented:)` modifiers in `MainContentView` into a single `.sheet(item:)` with an `ActiveSheet` enum — fixes SwiftUI anti-pattern where only the last `.sheet` modifier reliably activates
- Replaced blocking `Process.waitUntilExit()` calls in `SSHTunnelManager` with async `withCheckedContinuation`-based waiting, and replaced the fixed 1.5s sleep with active port probing — SSH tunnel setup no longer blocks the actor thread, keeping the UI responsive during connection
- Eliminated potential deadlocks in `MariaDBConnection` and `LibPQConnection` — replaced all `queue.sync` calls (in `disconnect`, `deinit`, `isConnected`, `serverVersion`) with lock-protected cached state and `queue.async` cleanup, preventing deadlocks when callbacks re-enter the connection queue
- SQL editor now respects the macOS accessibility text size preference (System Settings > Accessibility > Display > Text Size) — the user's chosen font size is scaled by the system's preferred text size factor, with live updates when the setting changes
- Fixed retain cycle in `UpdaterBridge` — `.assign(to:on:self)` retains self strongly; replaced with `.sink` using `[weak self]`
- Fixed leaked NotificationCenter observer in `SQLEditorCoordinator` — observer token is now stored and removed in `destroy()`
- Eliminated tab switching delay — replaced view teardown/recreation with `ZStack`+`ForEach` to keep NSViews alive, moved tab persistence I/O to background threads, skipped unnecessary change-tracking deep copies, and coalesced redundant inspector/sidebar updates during tab switch
- Reduced tab-switch CPU spikes from 40-60% to ~10-20% by eliminating redundant `reloadData()` calls: `configureForTable` no longer triggers a reload during tab switch (single controlled bump instead of 2-3), `onChange(of: resultColumns)` is suppressed while the switch is in progress, and `DataGridView.updateNSView` skips all heavy work when the data identity hasn't changed
- Table open now shows data instantly — split `executeQueryInternal` into two phases: rows display immediately after SELECT completes, metadata (columns, FKs, enums, row count) loads in the background without blocking the grid
- Eliminated 20-80ms overhead when clicking an already-open table in the sidebar — `openTableTab` short-circuits immediately, and `TableProTabSmart` no longer fires `@Published` when the selected tab hasn't changed
- Keychain `SecItemAdd` return values are now checked and logged — previously, failed writes (e.g. `errSecDuplicateItem`, `errSecInteractionNotAllowed`) were silently discarded, risking password loss
- Added `kSecAttrService` to all Keychain queries across `ConnectionStorage`, `LicenseStorage`, and `AIKeyStorage` — items now have a proper service identifier, preventing potential collisions with other apps
- Ensured proper cleanup for `@State` reference type tokens — tracked untracked `Task` instances in `ImportDialog` (file selection), `AIProviderEditorSheet` (model fetching, connection test), and added `onDisappear` cancellation to prevent leaked work after view dismissal
- Replaced `.onAppear` with `.task` for I/O operations in `ConnectionTagEditor` — uses SwiftUI-idiomatic lifecycle-tied loading instead of `onAppear` which can re-fire on navigation

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-19

### Changed

- AI chat panel — native macOS inspector styling: removed iOS-style chat bubbles, flattened message layout with role headers and compact spacing, reduced heading sizes for narrow sidebar, inline typing indicator without pill background
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** migrated 5 NSPopover controllers (Enum, Set, TypePicker, JSONEditor, ForeignKey) to SwiftUI content views with a shared `PopoverPresenter` utility — eliminates manual `NSEvent` monitors, `NSPopoverDelegate`, and singleton patterns
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `KeyEventHandler` NSViewRepresentable with native `.onKeyPress()` modifiers (macOS 14+) in DatabaseSwitcherSheet and WelcomeWindowView
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced AppKit history panel (5 files: `HistoryPanelController`, `HistoryListViewController`, `QueryPreviewViewController`, `HistoryTableView`, `HistoryRowView`) with single pure SwiftUI `HistoryPanelView` using `HSplitView`, `List` with selection, context menus, and swipe-to-delete
- **AppKit → SwiftUI migration:** replaced `ExportTableOutlineView` (NSOutlineView, 757 lines across 2 files) with SwiftUI `ExportTableTreeView` using `List`, `DisclosureGroup`, and tristate checkboxes (~146 lines)
- **Design tokens:** replaced hardcoded `Color.secondary.opacity(0.6)` with system `Color(nsColor: .tertiaryLabelColor)` in `DesignConstants` and `ToolbarDesignTokens` for proper semantic color

### Added

- Per-connection AI policy — control AI access per connection (Always Allow, Ask Each Time, Never) in the connection form
- Toggle AI Chat keyboard shortcut (`⌘⇧L`) and toolbar button
- Tab reuse setting — opt-in option in Settings > Tabs to reuse clean table tabs when clicking a new table in the sidebar (off by default)

- Keyboard shortcut customization in Settings > Keyboard — rebind any menu shortcut via press-to-record UI, with conflict detection and "Reset to Defaults" support
- Keyboard shortcut for Switch Connection (`⌘⌥C`) — quickly open the connection switcher popover from the menu or keyboard

### Changed

- **Layout architecture:** replaced `SplitViewMinWidthEnforcer` NSViewRepresentable hack with proper AppDelegate-based inspector split view configuration — eliminates KVO observation, 300ms sleep, and recursive view tree traversal
- **Inspector data flow:** replaced manual snapshot syncing (`syncRightPanelSnapshotData()` + 5 `onChange` handlers) with `InspectorContext` value type passed directly through the view hierarchy via `@Binding`
- **Right panel state:** `RightPanelState` no longer holds snapshot copies of coordinator data or a weak coordinator reference — it now only manages panel visibility, tab state, and owned objects
- **AI chat panel:** receives `currentQuery: String?` parameter instead of a `MainContentCoordinator` reference — better separation of concerns
- **Sidebar save:** replaced `.saveSidebarChanges` notification with direct closure (`RightPanelState.onSave`) set by the notification handler
- Structure tab grid columns now auto-size to fit content on data load
- Structure view column headers and status messages are now localized
- SQL autocomplete: 50ms debounce for completion triggers to reduce unnecessary work

- **PostgreSQL:** DDL tab now includes PRIMARY KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK, and FOREIGN KEY constraints plus standalone indexes
- **PostgreSQL:** primary key columns are now correctly detected and displayed in the structure grid
- **Security:** escape table and database names in all driver schema queries to prevent SQL injection from names containing special characters
- **SQL editor:** undo/redo (⌘Z / ⇧⌘Z) now works correctly (was blocked by responder chain selector mismatch)
- **SQL autocomplete:** clause detection now works correctly inside subqueries
- **SQL autocomplete:** block comment detection no longer treats `--` inside `/* */` as a line comment
- **SQL autocomplete:** database-specific type keywords (e.g., PostgreSQL `JSONB`, MySQL `ENUM`) now appear in suggestions
- **SQL autocomplete:** schema suggestions no longer disappear after CREATE TABLE
- **SQL autocomplete:** function completion now inserts `COUNT()` with cursor between parentheses instead of `COUNT(`
- **SQL autocomplete:** RETURNING suggestions now work after INSERT INTO and after closed `VALUES (...)` parentheses
- **SQL autocomplete:** CREATE INDEX ON suggests columns from the referenced table instead of table names
